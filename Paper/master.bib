	abstract = {Catalytic epidemic models are concerned with the age distribution at attack of infectious disease. A catalytic linear infection model, in which it is assumed that the force of infection acting on an individual is a linear function of age, is developed and applied to measles. The model is fitted to measles incidence data in England and Wales for the period 1956-69. Trends in time and differences between populations in estimated parameter values are discussed. In particular, it is observed that the (estimated) mean age at attack has decreased linearly with time over that period. It is hypothesized that the introduction of large-scale vaccination programmes may alter the age distribution of attack among the remaining susceptibles.},

	abstract = {Serological surveys are a useful source of information about epidemiological parameters for infectious diseases. In particular they may be used to estimate contact rates, forces of infection, the reproduction number and the critical vaccination threshold. However, these estimation methods require the assumption that the infection is in endemic equilibrium. Such equilibria seldom exist in practice: for example, many common infections of childhood exhibit regular epidemic cycles. In this paper, we investigate whether ignoring such cycles produces biased estimates. We apply the methods to data on mumps and rubella in the U.K. prior to the introduction of the combined measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. We conclude that past epidemics have only a marginal effect on estimates, and that standard methods that do not adjust for regular epidemics are valid. Copyright Â© 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We report on a preliminary study to identify such mixing patterns. A sample of 92 adults were asked to detail the individuals with whom they had conversed over the period of one, randomly assigned, day. Sixty-five (71\%) completed the questionnaire, providing their age, the age of their contacts and the social context in which the contacts took place. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts. Surveys of this nature may enable the quantification of who acquires infection from whom and from where.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that ecological interference among some childhood diseases may have important dynamic consequences. An interesting question is, when would we expect the interference effect to be pronounced? To address the issue, here we develop a seasonally forced two-disease age-structured model, using empirically derived age-specific force of infection (ASFOI) for numerous infections of childhood. Our comparative numerical analysis shows that when the ASFOIs for the two diseases largely overlap, the dynamics predicted by the two-disease model are generally different from those predicted by the analogous single-disease model, suggesting strong fingerprints of disease interference. When the ASFOIs overlap less, on the other hand, both diseases behave as predicted by the single-disease model, suggesting weak interference. We conclude that age structure is an important factor that should be taken into account in order to explore the underlying mechanisms of disease interference.},

	abstract = {Many pathogens spread primarily via direct contact between infected and susceptible hosts. Thus, the patterns of contacts or contact network of a population fundamentally shape the course of epidemics. While there is a robust and growing theory for the dynamics of single epidemics in networks, we know little about the impacts of network structure on long-term epidemic or endemic transmission. For seasonal diseases like influenza, pathogens repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of susceptibility and immunity acquired through prior infection. Here, we develop two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity. Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and polarized immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune. By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population, such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these dynamics can result in evolutionary pressure to increase infectiousness.},

We show how to calculate the threshold vaccination coverage rate that will eradicate an infection, explore the impact of vaccine-induced immunity that wanes through time, and study the competitive interactions between vaccine susceptible and vaccine resistant strains of infectious agent.},

Most current models, including the stochastic seasonally forced and age-structured models examined here, fail to capture simultaneously the observed dynamics and persistence characteristics of epidemics in large urban populations before vaccination. Summary measures of persistence and trienniality allow us to compare epidemics in England, New York and Copenhagen with results of non-spatial and spatial stochastic models. Spatial (metapopulation) structure allows persistence and triennial dynamics to coexist in this class of models. The spatial dynamics of measles, for which detailed spatiotemporal data are available, may serve as a useful test of ideas applicable to other epidemiological and ecological systems with an important spatial component.},

However, maintenance of elimination in parts of Africa, Europe, the USA, and other regions is proving difficult, despite apparently high vaccine coverage. This may be due to the different age structure in developed and developing populations, as well as to differences in the duration of maternal immunity. We explore the interaction between maternal immunity and age structure and quantify the resulting immunity gap between vaccine coverage and population immunity; we use this immunity gap as a novel metric of vaccine program success as it highlights the difference between actual and estimated immunity. We find that, for some combinations of maternal immunity and age structure, the accepted herd immunity threshold is not maintainable with a single-dose vaccine strategy for any combination of target age and coverage. In all cases, the herd immunity threshold is more difficult to maintain in a population with developing age structure. True population immunity is always improved if the target age at vaccination is chosen for the specific combination of maternal immunity and age structure.},

	abstract = {BackgroundÂ It is unknown whether vaccine-induced immunity is lifelong in the absence of periodic exposure to measles virus. After 27 years of no known exposure to measles, an outbreak in Palau in 1993 offered the opportunity to study this issue and the measles vaccine effectiveness.
        MethodsÂ Household contacts of a sample of confirmed cases were interviewed for exposure, symptoms and vaccination status verified by records. Serum from symptomatic contacts was tested for measles antibodies.
        ResultsÂ Among 78 contacts 4 of 5 (80\%) unvaccinated, 4 of 35 (11\%) 1-dose vaccine recipients and none of 38 (0\%) {\textgreater}1-dose recipients developed measles. Effectiveness of 1-dose vaccine was 86\% (95\% confidence interval, 60 to 95\%). An additional dose significantly reduced the risk of measles (P = 0.048). Time since vaccination was not a significant risk factor for developing measles (relative risk, 1.6; 95\% confidence interval, 0.3 to 9.4; persons vaccinated {\textgreater}15 years ago vs. {\textless}5 years ago).
        ConclusionsÂ Similar to the estimates previously obtained in the area, measles vaccine effectiveness in Palau was lower than the estimates obtained in the US. A second dose of vaccine further reduced the risk for developing measles. We found no evidence that waning immunity was an important problem in this limited population with no known previous exposure to measles virus. The small number of vaccinated contacts precludes a definitive assessment.},

Measles was eliminated in the Americas in 2002 by a combination of routine immunizations and supplementary immunization activities. Recent outbreaks underscore the importance of reconsidering vaccine policy in order to maintain elimination. We constructed an age-structured dynamical model for the distribution of immunity in a population with routine immunization and without disease, and analysed the steady state for an idealized age structure and for real age structures of countries in the Americas. We compared the level of immunity maintained by current policy in these countries to the level maintainable by an optimal policy. The optimal age target for the first routine dose of measles vaccine depends on the timing and coverage of both doses. Similarly, the optimal age target for the second dose of measles vaccine depends on the timing and coverage of the first dose. The age targets for the first and second doses of measles vaccine should be adjusted for the post-elimination era, by specifically accounting for current context, including realized coverage of both doses, and altered maternal immunity. Doing so can greatly improve the proportion immune within a population, and therefore the chances of maintaining measles elimination, without changing coverage.},

In the absence of a global or regional body that can impose a universal vaccination strategy, each individual country sets its own strategy. Mobility of populations across borders can promote free-riding, because a country can benefit from the vaccination efforts of its neighbours, which can result in vaccination coverage lower than the global optimum. Here we explore whether voluntary coalitions that reward countries that join by cooperatively increasing vaccination coverage can solve this problem. We use dynamic epidemiological models embedded in a game-theoretic framework in order to identify conditions in which coalitions are self-enforcing and therefore stable, and thus successful at promoting a cooperative vaccination strategy. We find that countries can achieve significantly greater vaccination coverage at a lower cost by forming coalitions than when acting independently, provided a coalition has the tools to deter free-riding. Furthermore, when economically or epidemiologically asymmetric countries form coalitions, realized coverage is regionally more consistent than in the absence of coalitions.},

We reappraise measles seroepidemiological data in Taiwan from 1974 to 2004 having robust age-stratified serological information on exposure and immunity to quantitatively characterize measles vaccination programmes. We dynamically model measles seroepidemiology to estimate age-dependent intensity of infection associated with the effects of different contact patterns on pre- and post-vaccination. The WAIFM (who acquires infection from whom) contact matrix is employed to describe the transmission between and within each age group. A deterministic SEIR (susceptibleâ€“exposedâ€“infectedâ€“recovery) model is used to capture subpopulation dynamics. Our study shows that mass regional or nationwide vaccination programmes could greatly reduce the potential for a major measles epidemic and have strong direct effects on the potential impact of childhood vaccination. We parameterize a predictive model that should reduce the socio-economic costs of measles surveillance in Taiwan and thereby encourage its continuance, especially for preschool children.},

This information is used at both the global and national level for planning and allocating performance-based funds. However, the validity of household-derived coverage sources has not yet been widely assessed or discussed. To advance knowledge on the validity of different sources of immunization coverage, we undertook a global review of literature. We assessed concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and coverage percentage point difference when subtracting household vaccination source from a medical provider source. Median coverage difference per paper ranged from -61 to +1 percentage points between card versus provider sources and -58 to +45 percentage points between recall versus provider source. When card and recall sources were combined, median coverage difference ranged from -40 to +56 percentage points. Overall, concordance, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value showed poor agreement, providing evidence that household vaccination information may not be reliable, and should be interpreted with care. While only 5 papers (11\%) included in this review were from low-middle income countries, low-middle income countries often rely more heavily on household vaccination information for decision making. Recommended actions include strengthening quality of child-level data and increasing investments to improve vaccination card availability and card marking. There is also an urgent need for additional validation studies of vaccine coverage in low and middle income countries.},

	abstract = {In the absence of vaccination card data, Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) managers sometimes ask mothers for their children's vaccination histories. The magnitude of maternal recall error and its potential impact on public health policy has not been investigated. In this study of 1171 Costa Rican mothers, we compare mothers' recall with vaccination card data for their children younger than 3 years. Analyses of vaccination coverage distributions constructed with recall and vaccination-card data show that recall can be used to estimate population coverage. Although the two data sources are correlated (r = .71), the magnitude of their difference can affect the identification of the vaccination status of an individual child. Maternal recall error was greater than two doses 14\% of the time. This error is negatively correlated with the number of doses recorded on the vaccination card (r = -.61) and is weakly correlated with the child's age (r = -.35). Mothers tended to remember accurately the vaccination status of children younger than 6 months, but with older children, the larger the number of doses actually received, the more the mother underestimated the number of doses. No other variables explained recall error. Therefore, reliance on maternal recall could lead to revaccinating children who are already protected, leaving a risk those most vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental problems in public health is how to allocate a limited set of resources to have the greatest benefit on the health of the population. This often leads to difficult value judgements about budget allocations. However, one scenario that is directly amenable to mathematical analysis is the optimal allocation of a finite stockpile of vaccine when the population is partitioned into many relatively small cliques, often conceptualised as households. For the case of SIR (susceptibleâ€“infectiousâ€“recovered) dynamics, analysis and numerics have supported the conjecture that an equalising strategy (which leaves equal numbers of susceptible individuals in each household) is optimal under certain conditions. However, there exists evidence that some of these conditions may be invalid or unsuitable in many situations. Here we consider how well the equalising strategy performs in a range of other scenarios that deviate from the idealised household model. We find that in general the equalising strategy often performs optimally, even far from the idealised case. However, when considering large subpopulation sizes, frequency-dependent transmission and intermediate levels of vaccination, optimality is often achieved through more heterogeneous vaccination strategies.},

The aim of this study was to use the unique resource of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) to examine trends in and factors associated with timeliness of infant vaccination at the national level. As in previous studies, age-appropriate immunisation was defined as within 30 days of the recommended age. Vaccination delays became more common for later doses, given at an older age, but long delay (greater than 6 months) occurred in only 1â€“2\%. Although immunisation coverage increased over time, timeliness did not improve. Among Indigenous infants, long delays occurred in 5â€“12\% of those residing in very remote areas, but by 2 years of age, overall immunisation coverage was similar to non-Indigenous children. With immunisation coverage at the key indicator ages of 12 and 24 months now high in most industrialised countries including Australia, timeliness of vaccine doses should be the next benchmark to aim for in program performance, especially in specific sub-groups such as Indigenous children who stand to gain most from prevention of early onset disease.},

We measured vaccination timeliness and vaccination coverage in three geographical areas in South Africa.MethodsThis study used vaccination information from a community-based cluster-randomized trial promoting exclusive breastfeeding in three South African sites (Paarl in the Western Cape Province, and Umlazi and Rietvlei in KwaZulu-Natal) between 2006 and 2008. Five interview visits were carried out between birth and up to 2 years of age (median follow-up time 18 months), and 1137 children were included in the analysis. We used Kaplan-Meier time-to-event analysis to describe vaccination coverage and timeliness in line with the Expanded Program on Immunization for the first eight vaccines. This included Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), four oral polio vaccines and 3 doses of the pentavalent vaccine which protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B.ResultsThe proportion receiving all these eight recommended vaccines were 94\% in Paarl (95\% confidence interval [CI] 91-96), 62\% in Rietvlei (95\%CI 54-68) and 88\% in Umlazi (95\%CI 84-91). Slightly fewer children received all vaccines within the recommended time periods. The situation was worst for the last pentavalent- and oral polio vaccines. The hazard ratio for incomplete vaccination was 7.2 (95\%CI 4.7-11) for Rietvlei compared to Paarl.ConclusionsThere were large differences between the different South African sites in terms of vaccination coverage and timeliness, with the poorer areas of Rietvlei performing worse than the better-off areas in Paarl. The vaccination coverage was lower for the vaccines given at an older age. There is a need for continued efforts to improve vaccination coverage and timeliness, in particular in rural areas.Trial registration numberClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00397150},

This study evaluated the vaccine coverage, timeliness, and barriers to immunization of MCV1 and MCV2 in children aged from 8â€“48 months.   MethodsWe assessed 718 children aged 8â€“48 months, of which 499 children aged 18â€“48 months in September 2011. Face to face interviews were administered with childrenâ€™s mothers to estimate MCV1 and MCV2 coverage rate, its timeliness and barriers to vaccine uptake.   ResultsThe coverage rates were 76.9\% for MCV1 and 44.7\% for MCV2 in average. Only 47.5\% of surveyed children received the MCV1 timely, which postpone vaccination by up to one month beyond the stipulated age of 8 months. Even if coverage thus improves with time, postponed vaccination adds to the pool of unprotected children in the population. Being unaware of the necessity for vaccination and its schedule, misunderstanding of side-effect of vaccine, and child being sick during the recommended vaccination period were significant preventive factors for both MCV1 and MCV2 vaccination. Having multiple children, motherâ€™s education level, household income and children with working mothers were significantly associated with delayed or missing MCV1 immunization.

The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.},

Computational simulations of epidemics provide a valuable tool for the study of the dynamics of epidemics. In such simulations, populations are represented by networks, where hosts and their interactions among each other are represented by nodes and edges. In the past few years, it has become clear that many human social networks have a very remarkable property: they all exhibit strong community structure. A network with strong community structure consists of smaller sub-networks (the communities) that have many connections within them, but only few between them. Here we use both data from social networking websites and computer generated networks to study the effect of community structure on epidemic spread. We find that community structure not only affects the dynamics of epidemics in networks, but that it also has implications for how networks can be protected from large-scale epidemics.},

	abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a â€˜mixing networkâ€™. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networksâ€”and how these deviate from the random-mixing normâ€”have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.
Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

The critical feature of this model is that the community is modelled as a small-world network of interconnected nodes. Each node is linked to a fixed number of immediate neighbors and a random number of geographically remote nodes. Transmission can only propagate between linked nodes. This model exhibits two features typical of SARS transmission: geographically localized outbreaks and â€œsuper-spreadersâ€. Neither of these features are evident in standard susceptible-infected-removed models of disease transmission. Our analysis indicates that â€œsuper-spreadersâ€ may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant. Moreover, we find that nosocomial transmission in Hong Kong directly contributed to the severity of the outbreak and that by limiting individual exposure time to 3â€“5 days the extent of the SARS epidemic would have been minimal.},

Two components of the settlement are investigated; (1) points of entry and (2) intra-city mobility. Current notions about migrant settlement patterns in Latin American cities are then examined in the light of these findings. It was found that migrants arriving in Monterrey from rural and small-town backgrounds have tended to concentrate outside the center-most parts of the city on arrival. Generally migrants who changed neighborhoods after arrival tended to direct their moves outward from the site of their initial location. However, even in the case of migrants who settled in the central parts of the city and then moved outward, only a fifth relocated at the extreme periphery. Substantial numbers moved only short distances or moved toward the center of the city. While in recent years migrants involved in peripherally directed moves tended to experience more occupational mobility than other migrants, about three fourths of the outward movers experienced little or no upward occupational mobility between arrival and move. Furthermore, more than three fifths of upwardly mobile migrants either did not move or relocated closer to the center of the city.},

As part of a longitudinal study of social and environmental change, a migrant follow-up was conducted that tracked and surveyed adults from 22 survey villages who had out-migrated to Bangkok, Thailand, Korat, Buriram, and the Eastern Seaboard. Global positioning system (GPS) locations for 1022 migrants from the Nang Rong district, who settled in Bangkok, were collected and linked to the demographic surveys. Using these locations, and linking to urban migrant and rural household surveys, we report on the spatial pattern of migrants and their urban settings through remote sensing and statistical analyses. The spatial patterns of migrants' locations in Bangkok are examined using nearest neighbour analysis to determine whether migrants live in spatial clusters organized by economic activity, demographic characteristics, or rural village residence patterns. Neighbourhood environments of migrants' locations are characterized using remotely sensed imagery with an emphasis on the amount of impervious cover in spatially prescribed neighbourhoods that surround migrants' locations. The results show that the spatial clustering of migrants was significant for 12 of the 22 study villages, and the levels of spatial clustering were most associated with education and occupation variables. The neighbourhood environments of the migrants, indicated by the percentage of impervious cover and the mean impervious patch size, were modelled as a function of demographic and geographic variables, suggesting scale dependence of the findings.},

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 133 migrant women from Myanmar living in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA).

Their size, their population density, their layout, their concentration of infrastructures, their socio-occupational profile and the trading activities they have developed give them urban features. Yet their durability depends on other factors, including the relationship between refugees and the indigenous population, and the ecological environment, i.e. access to local resources. This article argues that a political backing is crucial since the host country can facilitate or forbid refugee settlements. In any case, a complete withdrawal or a sudden contraction of humanitarian aid would not automatically mean the closure of camps: whether because self-sustainability would allow virtual cities to emerge as market towns, or because refugees would refuse to come back home and would become clandestine migrants.},

The camps are both the emblem of the social condition created by the coupling of war with humanitarian action, the site where it is constructed in the most elaborate manner, as a life kept at a distance from the ordinary social and political world, and the experimentation of the large-scale segregations that are being established on a planetary scale. Created in a situation of emergency as a protective device intended to provide for the physical, food and health safety of all kinds of survivors and fugitives from wars, refugee camps agglomerate tens of thousands of inhabitants for periods that generally last far beyond the duration of the emergency. In this article, we describe and analyse camps as an urban ethnographic case. Social and cultural complexities emerge with the formation of the novel sociospatial form of `city-camps' in which new identities crystallize and subjectivation takes root.},

	abstract = {Since the early 1990s, refugee crises in the Balkans, Central Africa, the Middle East, and West Africa have led to the international spread of civil war. In Central Africa alone, more than three million people have died in wars fueled, at least in part, by internationally supported refugee populations. The recurring pattern of violent refugee crises prompts the following questions: Under what conditions do refugee crises lead to the spread of civil war across borders? How can refugee relief organizations respond when militants use humanitarian assistance as a tool of war? What government actions can prevent or reduce conflict? To understand the role of refugees in the spread of conflict, Sarah Kenyon Lischer systematically compares violent and nonviolent crises involving Afghan, Bosnian, and Rwandan refugees. Lischer argues against the conventional socioeconomic explanations for refugee-related violenceâ€”abysmal living conditions, proximity to the homeland, and the presence of large numbers of bored young men. Lischer instead focuses on the often-ignored political context of the refugee crisis. She suggests that three factors are crucial: the level of the refugees' political cohesion before exile, the ability and willingness of the host state to prevent military activity, and the contribution, by aid agencies and outside parties, of resources that exacerbate conflict. Lischer's political explanation leads to policy prescriptions that are sure to be controversial: using private security forces in refugee camps or closing certain camps altogether. With no end in sight to the brutal wars that create refugee crises, Dangerous Sanctuaries is vital reading for anyone concerned with how refugee flows affect the dynamics of conflicts around the world.},

	abstract = {Nearly half of the world's eight million Palestinians are registered refugees, having faced partition and exile. Landscape of Hope and Despair examines this refugee experience in Lebanon through the medium of spatial practices and identity, set against the backdrop of prolonged violence. Julie Peteet explores how Palestinians have dealt with their experience as refugees by focusing attention on how a distinctive Palestinian identity has emerged from and been informed by fifty years of refugee history. Concentrating ethnographic scrutiny on a site-specific experience allows the author to shed light on the mutually constitutive character of place and cultural identification.Palestinian refugee camps are contradictory places: sites of grim despair, but also of hope and creativity. Within these cramped spaces, refugees have crafted new worlds of meaning and visions of the possible in politics. In the process, their historical predicament was a point of departure for social action and thus became radically transformed. Beginning with the calamity of 1948, Landscape of Hope and Despair traces the dialectic of place and cultural identification through the initial despair of the 1950s and early 1960s to the tumultuous days of the resistance and the violence of the Lebanese civil war and its aftermath. Most significantly, this study articulates space, place, and identity to construct an alternative to the received national narratives of Palestinian society and history. The moving stories told here form a larger picture of these refugees as a people struggling to recreate their sense of place and identity and add meaning to their surroundings through the use of culture and memory.},

The paradigm is provided by extremely contagious, acute, immunizing childhood infections. Partially synchronized, unstable oscillations are punctuated by local extinctions. This, in turn, can result in spatial differentiation in the timing of epidemics and, depending on the nature of spatial contagion, may result in traveling waves. Measles epidemics are one of a few systems documented well enough to reveal all of these properties and how they are affected by spatiotemporal variations in population structure and demography. On the basis of a gravity coupling model and a time series susceptibleâ€infectedâ€recovered (TSIR) model for local dynamics, we propose a metapopulation model for regional measles dynamics. The model can capture all the major spatiotemporal properties in prevaccination epidemics of measles in England and Wales.},

Here we used 20 years of incidence reports from Mexico to identify variation in seasonal forcing and magnitude of transmission across the country and to explore determinants of inter-annual variability in epidemic magnitude in rubella. We found considerable regional variation in both magnitude of transmission and amplitude of seasonal variation in transmission. Several lines of evidence pointed to stochastic dynamics as an important driver of multi-annual cycles. Since average age of infection increased with the relative importance of stochastic dynamics, this conclusion has implications for the burden of congenital rubella syndrome. We discuss factors underlying regional variation, and implications of the importance of stochasticity for vaccination implementation.},

Over the 37-year period, there was a 35-fold reduction in the incidence rates of P. falciparum malaria (11.86\% in 1965 versus 0.34\% in 2002) and a 7-fold reduction in P. vivax malaria (2.89\% in 1965 versus 0.40\% in 2002). The incidence ratio of P. falciparum to P. vivax malaria was reduced from 4.1 to 0.8 during this period. Malaria incidence rate exhibited the most rapid reduction between 1975 and 1985, coinciding with the introduction of a combination of antifolate drugs (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine). The distribution maps of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria incidence rates indicated a high spatial heterogeneity. The Thailand-Myanmar and Thailand-Cambodia border areas, where migration of foreign workers was pronounced, had the highest incidence rates for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed-species infections. Transition probability analysis based on the malaria incidence rate among Thai residents indicated that there was an overall trend of decrease in the number of malaria cases and the number of high incidence districts between 1997 and 2002. High spatial variation in malaria incidence and local human migration patterns suggest that malaria control measures need to be adjusted according to local environmental and demographic settings.},

Regional and local transmission patterns are rooted in human mixing behaviour across spatial scales. Identifying spatial interactions that contribute to recurring epidemics helps define and predict outbreak patterns. Using spatially explicit reported cases from measles outbreaks in Niger, we explored how regional variations in movement and contact patterns relate to patterns of measles incidence. Because we expected to see lower rates of re-introductions in small, compared to large, populations, we measured the population-size corrected proportion of weeks with zero cases across districts to understand relative rates of measles re-introductions. We found that critical elements of spatial disease dynamics in Niger are agricultural seasonality, transnational contact clusters, and roads networks that facilitate host movement and connectivity. These results highlight the need to understand local patterns of seasonality, demographic characteristics, and spatial heterogeneities to inform vaccination policy.},

	abstract = {While new mechanisms such as advance market commitments and co-financing policies of the GAVI Alliance are allowing low- and middle-income countries to gain access to vaccines faster than ever, understanding the full scope of vaccine program costs is essential to ensure adequate resource mobilization. This costing analysis examines the vaccine costs, supply chain costs, and service delivery costs of immunization programs for routine immunization and for supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) for vaccines related to 18 antigens in 94 countries across the decade, 2011â€“2020. Vaccine costs were calculated using GAVI price forecasts for GAVI-eligible countries, and assumptions from the PAHO Revolving Fund and UNICEF for middle-income countries not supported by the GAVI Alliance. Vaccine introductions and coverage levels were projected primarily based on GAVI's Adjusted Demand Forecast. Supply chain costs including costs of transportation, storage, and labor were estimated by developing a mechanistic model using data generated by the HERMES discrete event simulation models. Service delivery costs were abstracted from comprehensive multi-year plans for the majority of GAVI-eligible countries and regression analysis was conducted to extrapolate costs to additional countries.
The analysis shows that the delivery of the full vaccination program across 94 countries would cost a total of \$62 billion (95\% uncertainty range: \$43â€“\$87 billion) over the decade, including \$51 billion (\$34â€“\$73 billion) for routine immunization and \$11 billion (\$7â€“\$17 billion) for SIAs. More than half of these costs stem from service delivery at \$34 billion (\$21â€“\$51 billion)â€”with an additional \$24 billion (\$13â€“\$41 billion) in vaccine costs and \$4 billion (\$3â€“\$5 billion) in supply chain costs.
The findings present the global costs to attain the goals envisioned during the Decade of Vaccines to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities. By projecting the full costs of immunization programs, our findings may aid to garner greater country and donor commitments toward adequate resource mobilization and efficient allocation. As service delivery costs have increasingly become the main driver of vaccination program costs, it is essential to pay additional consideration to health systems strengthening.},

METHODS: We develop an age-stratified dynamic compartmental model of measles transmission. We explore the frequency of SIAs in order to achieve measles control in selected countries and two Indian states with high measles burden. Specifically, we compute the maximum allowable time period between two consecutive SIAs to achieve measles control.
RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that a single SIA will not control measles transmission in any of the countries with high measles burden. However, regular SIAs at high coverage levels are a viable strategy to prevent measles outbreaks. The periodicity of SIAs differs between countries and even within a single country, and is determined by population demographics and existing routine immunization coverage.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis can guide country policymakers deciding on the optimal scheduling of SIA campaigns and the best combination of routine and SIA vaccination to control measles.},

	abstract = {Background
Decreasing trends in measles mortality have been reported in recent years. However, such estimates of measles mortality have depended heavily on assumed regional measles case fatality risks (CFRs) and made little use of mortality data from low- and middle-income countries in general and India, the country with the highest measles burden globally, in particular.

Methods
We constructed a dynamic model of measles transmission in India with parameters that were empirically inferred using spectral analysis from a time series of measles mortality extracted from the Million Death Study, an ongoing longitudinal study recording deaths across 2.4 million Indian households and attributing causes of death using verbal autopsy. The model was then used to estimate the measles CFR, the number of measles deaths, and the impact of vaccination in 2000â€“2015 among under-five children in India and in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP), two states with large populations and the highest numbers of measles deaths in India.

Results
We obtained the following estimated CFRs among under-five children for the year 2005: 0.63\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.40â€“1.00\%) for India as a whole, 0.62\% (0.38â€“1.00\%) for Bihar, and 1.19\% (0.80â€“1.75\%) for UP. During 2000â€“2015, we estimated that 607,000 (95\% CI: 383,000â€“958,000) under-five deaths attributed to measles occurred in India as a whole. If no routine vaccination or supplemental immunization activities had occurred from 2000 to 2015, an additional 1.6 (1.0â€“2.6) million deaths for under-five children would have occurred across India.

Conclusions
We developed a data- and model-driven estimation of the historical measles dynamics, CFR, and vaccination impact in India, extracting the periodicity of epidemics using spectral and coherence analysis, which allowed us to infer key parameters driving measles transmission dynamics and mortality.

A survey in 8 districts showed routine coverage of 95.0\% for children 12â€“23 months; 57.9\% for children 9â€“11 months; and 60.7\% for children covered during the last supplementary immunization activities in 2008. Vaccine effectiveness was 83.9\% for 1 dose and 90.5\% for 2 doses. A continuous accumulation of susceptible persons during the past decade probably accounts for this outbreak.

Estimates of the percent reductions from baseline to recent were made without adjustment for factors that could affect vaccine-preventable disease morbidity, mortality, or reporting.ResultsÂ A greater than 92\% decline in cases and a 99\% or greater decline in deaths due to diseases prevented by vaccines recommended before 1980 were shown for diphtheria, mumps, pertussis, and tetanus. Endemic transmission of poliovirus and measles and rubella viruses has been eliminated in the United States; smallpox has been eradicated worldwide. Declines were 80\% or greater for cases and deaths of most vaccine-preventable diseases targeted since 1980 including hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, Hib, and varicella. Declines in cases and deaths of invasive S pneumoniae were 34\% and 25\%, respectively.ConclusionsÂ The number of cases of most vaccine-preventable diseases is at an all-time low; hospitalizations and deaths have also shown striking decreases.},

However, the heterogeneity in immunity, due to previous vaccination coverage or infection, may lead to potential bias of such campaigns toward those with previous high access to vaccination and may result in a lower-than-expected effective impact. During the 2010 measles outbreak in Malawi, only 3 of the 8 districts where vaccination occurred achieved a measureable effective campaign impact (i.e., a reduction in measles cases in the targeted age groups greater than that observed in nonvaccinated districts). Simulation models suggest that selective campaigns targeting hard-to-reach individuals are of greater benefit, particularly in highly vaccinated populations, even for low target coverage and with late implementation. However, the choice between targeted and nonselective campaigns should be context specific, achieving a reasonable balance of feasibility, cost, and expected impact. In addition, it is critical to develop operational strategies to identify and target hard-to-reach individuals.},

To describe measles epidemiology in Africa since the start of accelerated measles control activities in 2001, we analyzed regional measles case-based surveillance data for 2002â€“2009.
Methods. Country-years were grouped by 10-year moving average of routine measles vaccination coverage (aMCV1). Age was log transformed, and pair-wise comparisons of means were made. A Ï‡2 test was used to assess association between coverage and age groups. Cumulative percent curves and percentiles of age, dot plots with Loess curve, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient were calculated.
Results. Of 180,284 suspected cases, 73,009 (41\%) were confirmed as measles. Of these, the mean age was 79 months (median, 36 months; interquartile range, 16â€“96 months) and significantly younger in country-years with {\textless}50\% aMCV1 than those with 50\%â€“74\% aMCV1 (P = .03) and â‰¥75\% (P = .02).

Conclusions. During 2002â€“2009, the median age of confirmed measles was 36 months. In countries with â‰¥50\% aMCV1 coverage compared with low-coverage countries, age shifted to older children and young adults; for infants, age decreased slightly with higher coverage.},

Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with such outbreaks, a literature review was conducted as a basis for re-evaluating this policy. METHODS: Reports of supplementary immunization activities that were performed to control measles outbreaks in middle or low income countries were identified. The impact of the immunization activities on the course of each outbreak was evaluated by examining the data provided. RESULTS: Of 66 reports detailing a measles outbreak in a middle or low income country, 17 described supplementary immunization activities which included seven 'non-selective' immunization campaigns, three 'selective' campaigns and one use of an early 2-dose schedule. Eight of the reports commented on the impact of the response, five of which reported a reduction in outbreak morbidity. Only one of the reports, from an isolated island outbreak, provided sufficient data to support a possible reduction in outbreak-associated morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: There are limited data on the impact of measles outbreak immunization activities from developing countries. The available data do not support a change in the WHO recommended strategy for conducting a limited, if any, immunization response to such outbreaks. Immunization strategies which aim to prevent outbreaks may be more effective than campaigns to interrupt transmission of an outbreak which has already begun.

The authors reviewed the available literature to assess whether that WHO policy should stand or be changed. 66 reports were identified detailing a measles outbreak in middle- or low-income countries. 17 of those reports described supplementary immunization activities to control measles outbreaks which included seven nonselective immunization campaigns, three selective campaigns, and one use of an early two-dose schedule. Eight reports commented upon the impact of the intervention, five of which reported a reduction in outbreak morbidity. Only one report, from an isolated island outbreak, provided sufficient data to support a possible reduction in outbreak-associated morbidity.

	abstract = {Introduction
In seven southern African countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe), following implementation of a measles mortality reduction strategy starting in 1996, the number of annually reported measles cases decreased sharply to less than one per million population during 2006â€“2008. However, during 2009â€“2010, large outbreaks occurred in these countries. In 2011, a goal for measles elimination by 2020 was set in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region (AFR). We reviewed the implementation of the measles control strategy and measles epidemiology during the resurgence in the seven southern African countries.
Methods
Estimated coverage with routine measles vaccination, supplemental immunization activities (SIA), annually reported measles cases by country, and measles surveillance and laboratory data were analyzed using descriptive analysis.
Results
In the seven countries, coverage with the routine first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) decreased from 80\% to 65\% during 1996â€“2004, then increased to 84\% in 2011; during 1996â€“2011, 79,696,523 people were reached with measles vaccination during 45 SIAs. Annually reported measles cases decreased from 61,160 cases to 60 cases and measles incidence decreased to \&lt;1 case per million during 1996â€“2008. During 2009â€“2010, large outbreaks that included cases among older children and adults were reported in all seven countries, starting in South Africa and Namibia in mid-2009 and in the other five countries by early 2010. The measles virus genotype detected was predominantly genotype B3.
Conclusion
The measles resurgence highlighted challenges to achieving measles elimination in AFR by 2020. To achieve this goal, high two-dose measles vaccine coverage by strengthening routine immunization systems and conducting timely SIAs targeting expanded age groups, potentially including young adults, and maintaining outbreak preparedness to rapidly respond to outbreaks will be needed.},

	abstract = {Background. Measles caused mortality in {\textgreater}164,000 children in 2008, with most deaths occurring during outbreaks. Nonetheless, the impact and desirability of conducting measles outbreak response immunization (ORI) in middle- and low-income countries has been controversial. World Health Organization guidelines published in 1999 recommended against ORI in such settings, although recently these guidelines have been reversed for countries with measles mortality reduction goals.
Methods. We searched literature published during 1995â€“2009 for papers reporting on measles outbreaks. Papers identified were reviewed by 2 reviewers to select those that mentioned ORI. World Bank classification of country income was used to identify reports of outbreaks in middle- and low-income countries.
Results. We identified a total of 485 articles, of which 461 (95\%) were available. Thirty-eight of these papers reported on a total of 38 outbreaks in which ORI was used. ORI had a clear impact in 16 (42\%) of these outbreaks. In the remaining outbreaks, we were unable to independently assess the impact of ORI.
Conclusions. These findings generally support ORI in middle- and low-income countries. However, the decision to conduct ORI and the nature and extent of the vaccination response need to be made on a case-by-case basis.},

	abstract = {All countries in Africa have made a commitment to eliminate measles by 2020. This is laudable, as measles elimination will have a crucial impact on reducing childhood mortality. An important operational challenge is the resurgence of measles outbreaks in a number of countries; one of the main reasons for this is that many children are being missed by vaccination programmes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), outbreaks continue unabated despite repeated vaccination campaigns and high reported coverage by the Ministry of Health. This paper brings into question the effectiveness of the current approach and the need for better reflection on bottlenecks and strategies that can address this issue. If we are to eliminate measles by 2020, there will be a need for impetus, a need for decisive action to reach that goal and prevent unnecessary childhood deaths in countries such as the DRC.},

Examining measles epidemic spread in Kinshasa (DRC), and Niamey (Niger) reveals a progression of smaller epidemics.

In general, disease elimination has been defined as the reduction of incidence in a population to zero. However, measles is so contagious that zero incidence is difficult to achieve and sustain because the risk of imported measles remains while measles is endemic in any country. Also,imported cases will occasionally result in short chains of indigenous transmission unless a country achieves 100\% immunity. Therefore, the United States currently uses the absence of endemic measles (i.e., no indigenous chains of transmission persisting for â©¾1 year) as the programmatic goal for measles elimination. To document the absence of endemic measles in the United States, we compiled information on the epidemiology of measles, genotype distribution, population immunity, and adequacy of measles surveillance. A panel of experts, convened in March 2000 to review the data, concluded that measles is no longer endemic in the United States.},

	abstract = {More than a century of ecological studies have demonstrated the importance of demography in shaping spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics. Surprisingly, the impact of seasonal recruitment on infectious disease systems has received much less attention. Here, we present data encompassing 78 years of monthly natality in the USA, and reveal pronounced seasonality in birth rates, with geographical and temporal variation in both the peak birth timing and amplitude. The timing of annual birth pulses followed a latitudinal gradient, with northern states exhibiting spring/summer peaks and southern states exhibiting autumn peaks, a pattern we also observed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Additionally, the amplitude of United States birth seasonality was more than twofold greater in southern states versus those in the north. Next, we examined the dynamical impact of birth seasonality on childhood disease incidence, using a mechanistic model of measles. Birth seasonality was found to have the potential to alter the magnitude and periodicity of epidemics, with the effect dependent on both birth peak timing and amplitude. In a simulation study, we fitted an susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to simulated data, and demonstrated that ignoring birth seasonality can bias the estimation of critical epidemiological parameters. Finally, we carried out statistical inference using historical measles incidence data from New York City. Our analyses did not identify the predicted systematic biases in parameter estimates. This may be owing to the well-known frequency-locking between measles epidemics and seasonal transmission rates, or may arise from substantial uncertainty in multiple model parameters and estimation stochasticity.},

On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries, high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics. Here, however, we show that measles epidemics in Niger are highly episodic, particularly in the capital Niamey. Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmissionâ€”generating high amplitude epidemicsâ€”within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice, this leads to frequent stochastic fadeouts, interspersed with irregular, large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage, but still below the local elimination threshold, could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build-up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur.},

	abstract = {Formal decision-analytic methods can be used to frame disease control problems, the first step of which is to define a clear and specific objective. We demonstrate the imperative of framing clearly-defined management objectives in finding optimal control actions for control of disease outbreaks. We illustrate an analysis that can be applied rapidly at the start of an outbreak when there are multiple stakeholders involved with potentially multiple objectives, and when there are also multiple disease models upon which to compare control actions. The output of our analysis frames subsequent discourse between policy-makers, modellers and other stakeholders, by highlighting areas of discord among different management objectives and also among different models used in the analysis. We illustrate this approach in the context of a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Cumbria, UK using outputs from five rigorously-studied simulation models of FMD spread. We present both relative rankings and relative performance of controls within each model and across a range of objectives. Results illustrate how control actions change across both the base metric used to measure management success and across the statistic used to rank control actions according to said metric. This work represents a first step towards reconciling the extensive modelling work on disease control problems with frameworks for structured decision making.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In 2008 all WHO member states endorsed a target of 90\% reduction in measles mortality by 2010 over 2000 levels. We developed a model to estimate progress made towards this goal.
Methods
We constructed a state-space model with population and immunisation coverage estimates and reported surveillance data to estimate annual national measles cases, distributed across age classes. We estimated deaths by applying age-specific and country-specific case-fatality ratios to estimated cases in each age-country class.
Findings
Estimated global measles mortality decreased 74\% from 535â€ˆ300 deaths (95\% CI 347â€ˆ200â€“976â€ˆ400) in 2000 to 139â€ˆ300 (71â€ˆ200â€“447â€ˆ800) in 2010. Measles mortality was reduced by more than three-quarters in all WHO regions except the WHO southeast Asia region. India accounted for 47\% of estimated measles mortality in 2010, and the WHO African region accounted for 36\%.
Interpretation
Despite rapid progress in measles control from 2000 to 2007, delayed implementation of accelerated disease control in India and continued outbreaks in Africa stalled momentum towards the 2010 global measles mortality reduction goal. Intensified control measures and renewed political and financial commitment are needed to achieve mortality reduction targets and lay the foundation for future global eradication of measles.

	abstract = {The seminal paper by Daniel Bernoulli published in 1766 is put into a new perspective. After a short account of smallpox inoculation and of Bernoulliâ€™s life, the motivation for that paper and its impact are described. It determines the age-specific equilibrium prevalence of immune individuals in an endemic potentially lethal infectious disease. The gain in life expectancy after elimination of this cause of death can be explicitly expressed in terms of the case fatality and the endemic prevalence of susceptibles. Dâ€™Alembert developed in 1761 an alternative method for dealing with competing risks of death, which is also applicable to non-infectious diseases. Bernoulliâ€™s formula for the endemic prevalence of susceptibles has so far escaped attention. It involves the lifetime risk of the infection, the force of infection and the life expectancy at birth. A new formula for the basic reproduction number is derived which involves the average force of infection, the average case fatality and the life expectancy at the time of infection. One can use this estimate to assess the gain in life expectancy if only a fraction of the population is immunized.},

	abstract = {The spread of infectious disease through communities depends fundamentally on the underlying patterns of contacts between individuals. Generally, the more contacts one individual has, the more vulnerable they are to infection during an epidemic. Thus, outbreaks disproportionately impact the most highly connected demographics. Epidemics can then lead, through immunization or removal of individuals, to sparser networks that are more resistant to future transmission of a given disease. Using several classes of contact networksâ€”Poisson, scale-free and small-worldâ€”we characterize the structural evolution of a network due to an epidemic in terms of frailty (the degree to which highly connected individuals are more vulnerable to infection) and interference (the extent to which the epidemic cuts off connectivity among the susceptible population that remains following an epidemic). The evolution of the susceptible network over the course of an epidemic differs among the classes of networks; frailty, relative to interference, accounts for an increasing component of network evolution on networks with greater variance in contacts. The result is that immunization due to prior epidemics can provide greater community protection than random vaccination on networks with heterogeneous contact patterns, while the reverse is true for highly structured populations.},

	abstract = {Rubella is generally a mild childhood disease, but infection during early pregnancy may cause spontaneous abortion or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may entail a variety of birth defects. Since vaccination at levels short of those necessary to achieve eradication may increase the average age of infection, and thus potentially the CRS burden, introduction of the vaccine has been limited to contexts where coverage is high. Recent work suggests that spatial heterogeneity in coverage should also be a focus of concern. Here, we use a detailed dataset from South Africa to explore the implications of heterogeneous vaccination for the burden of CRS, introducing realistic vaccination scenarios based on reported levels of measles vaccine coverage. Our results highlight the potential impact of country-wide reductions of incidence of rubella on the local CRS burdens in districts with small population sizes. However, simulations indicate that if rubella vaccination is introduced with coverage reflecting current estimates for measles coverage in South Africa, the burden of CRS is likely to be reduced overall over a 30 year time horizon by a factor of 3, despite the fact that this coverage is lower than the traditional 80 per cent rule of thumb for vaccine introduction, probably owing to a combination of relatively low birth and transmission rates. We conclude by discussing the likely impact of private-sector vaccination.},

In this study we use early notification data and disease natural history parameters to estimate the basic reproductive number R0. Our estimates of the basic reproductive number for Zika in Rio de Janeiro (R0=3.9, 95\% CI: 3.1 -- 5.3) were higher than those obtained for dengue using data from two early epidemics in the city (year 2002: 2.5 [2.1 -- 3.1]; year 2012: 1.5 [1.4 -- 1.8]). Given the role of Aedes aegypti as an arbovirus vector, we also assessed the R0 of Zika given entomological and epidemiological factors already reported for dengue transmission. Surprisingly, we find that Zika's R0 under a vectorial-only transmission model is lower than the basic reproductive number for dengue. These results suggest that either our current knowledge regarding the vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti as a vector for Zika is incomplete or other modes of transmission are important players in sustaining this epidemic.},

After completing a brief questionnaire, women received a free voucher for HPV vaccination. Whether women redeemed the voucher for the initial dose of vaccine served as the study outcome variable.

	abstract = {All six WHO regions currently have goals for measles elimination by 2020. Measles vaccination is delivered via routine immunization programmes, which in most sub-Saharan African countries reach children around 9months of age, and supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), which target a wider age range at multi-annual intervals. In the absence of endemic measles circulation, the proportion of individuals susceptible to measles will gradually increase through accumulation of new unvaccinated individuals in each birth cohort, increasing the risk of an epidemic. The impact of SIAs and the financial investment they require, depend on coverage and target age range. We evaluated the impact of target population age range for periodic SIAs, evaluating outcomes for two different levels of coverage, using a demographic and epidemiological model adapted to reflect populations in 4 sub-Saharan African countries. We found that a single SIA can maintain elimination over short time-scales, even with low routine coverage. However, maintaining elimination for more than a few years is difficult, even with large (high coverage/wide age range) recurrent SIAs, due to the build-up of susceptible individuals. Across the demographic and vaccination contexts investigated, expanding SIAs to target individuals over 10years did not significantly reduce outbreak risk. Elimination was not maintained in the contexts we evaluated without a second opportunity for vaccination. In the absence of an expanded routine program, SIAs provide a powerful option for providing this second dose. We show that a single high coverage SIA can deliver most key benefits in terms of maintaining elimination, with follow-up campaigns potentially requiring smaller investments. This makes post-campaign evaluation of coverage increasingly relevant to correctly assess future outbreak risk.},

The evidence from censuses and satellite imagery is increasing that the rate at which many countries are becoming more urban in sub-Saharan Africa has slowed or is even stagnating. This has major policy implications. Many standard reviews of the region still, however, tend to maintain that urbanization is occurring rapidly but, as this paper demonstrates, the data used are frequently erroneous. Such errors are exacerbated by a lack of reasonable estimates of the size and growth of towns in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africaâ€™s most populous country with the regionâ€™s most complex urban system. This paper also attempts to address this knowledge gap and shows how Nigeriaâ€™s level of urbanization has also been significantly over-estimated.},

Our goals of the chapter are threefold: first, to establish the strengths and limitations of Courgeauâ€™s k as a summary measure of internal migration; second, to identify the extent of international differences in mobility; and third, to determine the general trajectory of internal migration over time.},

	abstract = {Seasonally driven cycles of incidence have been consistently observed for a range of directly transmitted pathogens. Though frequently observed, the mechanism of seasonality for directly transmitted human pathogens is rarely well understood. Despite significant annual variation in magnitude, measles outbreaks in Niger consistently begin in the dry season and decline at the onset of the seasonal rains. We estimate the seasonal fluctuation in measles transmission rates for the 38 districts and urban centres of Niger, from 11 years of weekly incidence reports. We show that transmission rates are consistently in anti-phase to the rainfall patterns across the country. The strength of the seasonal forcing of transmission is not correlated with the latitudinal rainfall gradient, as would be expected if transmission rates were determined purely by environmental conditions. Rather, seasonal forcing is correlated with the population size, with larger seasonal fluctuation in more populous, urban areas. This pattern is consistent with seasonal variation in human density and contact rates due to agricultural cycles. The stronger seasonality in large cities drives deep inter-epidemic troughs and results in frequent local extinction of measles, which contrasts starkly to the conventional observation that large cities, by virtue of their size, act as reservoirs of measles.},

With dynamic epidemic models, we demonstrate that measures of population density are essential for predicting epidemic progression at the city level and improving intervention strategies.

However, most of this research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. We question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. There are two reasons for this claim. First we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. Second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. Without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.},

Two competing mechanisms for the conditional or interactive relationship between race and SES on health are examined during a 20-year period for black and white Americans. Results show that black adults began the study with more serious illnesses and poorer self-rated health than white adults and that the disparity continued over the 20 years. Significant interactions were found between race and education as well as race and employment status on health outcomes. The interaction effect of race and education showed that the racial disparity in self-rated health was largest at the higher levels of SES, providing some evidence for the "diminishing returns" hypothesis; as education levels increased, black adults did not have the same improvement in self-rated health as white adults. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the continuing significance of both race and SES in determining health status over time.},

This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groupsâ€”such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discriminationâ€”systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (â€œSocial advantageâ€ refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given categoryâ€”e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic groupâ€”and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.},

We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems.

A primary focus was to provide pertinent information to aid clinicians in the management of pregnancies at risk for, exposed to, or with confirmed ZIKV infection.Method: An extensive literature review was performed using Pubmed. Practice guidelines and consensus reports were accessed from international, national, and professional organizationsâ€™ websites. The clinical articles for ZIKV infection testing varied from case reports to small epidemiologic studies.Results: A ZIKV epidemic has been declared in several countries in the Americas. Fifty-two travel-associated ZIKV infection cases have been reported throughout the USA (as of February 10, 2016). The consequences of congenital fetal/newborn ZIKV infection could potentially have devastating consequences including miscarriage, fetal death, and major anomalies such as microcephaly, brain and brain-stem defects, and long-term neurologic sequelae. While not definitive, current evidence suggests the existence of nonvector-borne transmission through sexual activity with an infected male partner. For women at risk for sexual transmission, condom use is advised, especially during pregnancy.Conclusion: While ZIKV infection appears to be a mild disease in the general population the potential consequences to the fetus and newborn could be profound. Management guidelines are currently evolving and will be significantly impacted as new evidence develops. It is therefore imperative that obstetric health-care providers keep abreast of this rapidly evolving information landscape that has so far characterized this outbreak.},

Zika virus was identified in Uganda in 1947; since then, it has enveloped the tropics, causing disease of varying severity. Lessler et al. review the historical literature to remind us that Zika's neurotropism was observed in mice even before clinical case reports in Nigeria in 1953. What determines the clinical manifestations; how local conditions, vectors, genetics, and wild hosts affect transmission and geographical spread; what the best control strategy is; and how to develop effective drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics are all critical questions that are begging for data.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDFirst discovered in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) received little attention until a surge in microcephaly cases was reported after a 2015 outbreak in Brazil. The size of the outbreak and the severity of associated birth defects prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 1 February 2016. In response, there has been an explosion in research and planning as the global health community has turned its attention to understanding and controlling ZIKV. Still, much of the information needed to evaluate the global health threat from ZIKV is lacking. The global threat posed by any emerging pathogen depends on its epidemiology, its clinical features, and our ability to implement effective control measures. Whether introductions of ZIKV result in epidemics depends on local ecology, population immunity, regional demographics, and, to no small degree, random chance. The same factors determine whether the virus will establish itself as an endemic disease. The burden of ZIKV spread on human health is mediated by its natural history and pathogenesis, particularly during pregnancy, and our ability to control the virusâ€™s spread. In this Review, we examine the empirical evidence for a global threat from ZIKV through the lens of these processes, examining historic and current evidence, as well as parallel processes in closely related viruses.
ADVANCESBecause ZIKV was not recognized as an important disease in humans until recently, it was little studied before the recent crisis. Nevertheless, the limited data from the decades following its discovery provide important clues into ZIKVâ€™s epidemiology and suggest that some populations were at risk for the virus for years in the mid-20th century, although this risk may predominantly have been the result of spillover infections from a sylvatic reservoir. Recent outbreaks on Yap Island (2007) and in French Polynesia (2014) provide the only previous observations of large epidemics and are the basis for the little that we do know about ZIKVâ€™s acute symptoms (e.g., rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia), the risk of birth defects, such as microcephaly (estimated to be 1 per 100 in French Polynesia), and the incidence of severe neurological outcomes (e.g., Guillain-BarrÃ© is estimated to occur in approximately 2 out of every 10,000 cases). The observation of an association between ZIKV and a surge in microcephaly cases in Brazil and the subsequent declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO have rapidly accelerated research into the virus. Small, but very important, studies have begun to identify the substantial risk the virus can pose throughout a pregnancy, and careful surveillance has established that ZIKV can be transmitted sexually. Numerous modeling studies have helped to estimate the potential range of ZIKV and measured its reproductive number R0 (estimates range from 1.4 to 6.6), a key measure of transmissibility in a number of settings. Still, it remains unclear whether the recent epidemic in the Americas is the result of fundamental changes in the virus or merely a chance event.
OUTLOOKZIKV research is progressing rapidly, and over the coming months and years our understanding of the virus will undoubtedly deepen considerably. Key questions about the virusâ€™s range, its ability to persist, and its clinical severity will be answered as the current epidemic in the Americas runs its course. Moving forward, it is important that information on ZIKV be placed within the context of its effect on human health and that we remain cognizant of the structure of postinvasion epidemic dynamics as we respond to this emerging threat. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6300/aaf8160/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The effect of ZIKV is a function of the local transmission regime and viral pathogenesis.(A) Many countries cannot maintain ongoing vector-mediated ZIKV transmission and are only at risk from importation by travelers and limited onward transmission (e.g., through sex). (B) If conditions are appropriate, importations can lead to postinvasion epidemics with high incidence across age ranges, after which the virus may go locally extinct or remain endemic. (C) There is evidence of ongoing ZIKV incidence in humans over years (e.g., a 1952 serosurvey in Nigeria), but it is unknown whether this is the result of ongoing circulation in humans or frequent spillover infections from a sylvatic cycle. (D) In other areas, ZIKV appears to have been maintained in animals with few human infections. (E) The majority of infections are asymptomatic, and severe outcomes, such as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, are rare. (F) However, there is considerable risk of microcephaly and other fetal sequelae when infection occurs during pregnancy.
First discovered in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection remained a little-known tropical disease until 2015, when its apparent association with a considerable increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil raised alarms worldwide. There is limited information on the key factors that determine the extent of the global threat from ZIKV infection and resulting complications. Here, we review what is known about the epidemiology, natural history, and public health effects of ZIKV infection, the empirical basis for this knowledge, and the critical knowledge gaps that need to be filled.

	abstract = {The global polio eradication initiative (GPEI), which started in 1988, represents the single largest, internationally coordinated public health project to date. Completion remains within reach, with type 2 wild polioviruses apparently eradicated since 1999 and fewer than 2000 annual paralytic poliomyelitis cases of wild types 1 and 3 reported since then. This economic analysis of the GPEI reflects the status of the program as of February 2010, including full consideration of post-eradication policies. For the GPEI intervention, we consider the actual pre-eradication experience to date followed by two distinct potential future post-eradication vaccination policies. We estimate GPEI costs based on actual and projected expenditures and poliomyelitis incidence using reported numbers corrected for underreporting and model projections. For the comparator, which assumes only routine vaccination for polio historically and into the future (i.e., no GPEI), we estimate poliomyelitis incidence using a dynamic infection transmission model and costs based on numbers of vaccinated children. Cost-effectiveness ratios for the GPEI vs. only routine vaccination qualify as highly cost-effective based on standard criteria. We estimate incremental net benefits of the GPEI between 1988 and 2035 of approximately 40â€“50billion dollars (2008 US dollars; 1988 net present values). Despite the high costs of achieving eradication in low-income countries, low-income countries account for approximately 85\% of the total net benefits generated by the GPEI in the base case analysis. The total economic costs saved per prevented paralytic poliomyelitis case drive the incremental net benefits, which become positive even if we estimate the loss in productivity as a result of disability as below the recommended value of one year in average per-capita gross national income per disability-adjusted life year saved. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the finding of positive net benefits of the GPEI remains robust over a wide range of assumptions, and that consideration of the additional net benefits of externalities that occurred during polio campaigns to date, such as the mortality reduction associated with delivery of Vitamin A supplements, significantly increases the net benefits. This study finds a strong economic justification for the GPEI despite the rising costs of the initiative.},

	abstract = {The history of polio vaccination in the United States spans 50 years and includes different phases of the disease, multiple vaccines, and a sustained significant commitment of resources. We estimated cost-effectiveness ratios and assessed the net benefits of polio vaccination applicable at various points in time from the societal perspective and we discounted these back to appropriate points in time. We reconstructed vaccine price data from available sources and used these to retrospectively estimate the total costs of the U.S. historical polio vaccination strategies (all costs reported in year 2002 dollars). We estimate that the United States invested approximately \$35 billion (1955 net present value, discount rate of 3\%) in polio vaccines between 1955 and 2005 and will invest approximately \$1.4 billion (1955 net present value, or \$6.3 billion in 2006 net present value) between 2006 and 2015 assuming a policy of continued use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) for routine vaccination. The historical and future investments translate into over 1.7 billion vaccinations that prevent approximately 1.1 million cases of paralytic polio and over 160,000 deaths (1955 net present values of approximately 480,000 cases and 73,000 deaths). Due to treatment cost savings, the investment implies net benefits of approximately \$180 billion (1955 net present value), even without incorporating the intangible costs of suffering and death and of averted fear. Retrospectively, the U.S. investment in polio vaccination represents a highly valuable, cost-saving public health program. Observed changes in the cost-effectiveness ratio estimates over time suggest the need for living economic models for interventions that appropriately change with time. This article also demonstrates that estimates of cost-effectiveness ratios at any single time point may fail to adequately consider the context of the investment made to date and the importance of population and other dynamics, and shows the importance of dynamic modeling.},

We use satellite imagery to quantify population fluctuations and the coverage achieved by a measles outbreak response vaccination campaign in urban Niger and compare campaign estimates to measurements from a post-campaign survey.

We combine satellite-derived measurements of fluctuations in population distribution with high-resolution measles case reports to develop a dynamic model that illustrates the potential improvement in vaccination campaign coverage if planners account for predictable population fluctuations.

	abstract = {Background Shortly after a measles supplementary immunization activity (SIA) targeting children from 9 months to 14 years of age that achieved high coverage, Burkina Faso had a large, serologically confirmed measles outbreak. To investigate the causes of this first reported failure of a widely successful measles control strategy we conducted a caseâ€“control study.Methods Serologically confirmed measles cases aged â‰¥9 months at the time of the SIA in 6 heavily affected districts were frequency matched on age to 3 controls recruited from people frequenting health centres in the same districts.Results Between January and July 2002, 1287 measles cases were reported throughout Burkina Faso. Of the 707 cases that were serologically confirmed, 358 (51\%) were from 9 months to 14 years of age and 265 (37\%) were â‰¥15 years of age. Among cases and controls from 9 months to 14 years of age significant risk factors for measles were lack of measles vaccination and, in the unvaccinated, recent travel to CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Of the recent measles cases in CÃ´te d'Ivoire 54\% were there when exposed to measles. Among adults, risk factors included non-vaccination and the lack of school attendance during childhood. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated to be 98\%.Conclusions Migration of children between CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso played a major role in the failure of the SIA to interrupt measles transmission. Synchronization of measles control activities should be a high priority in countries with regions where much migration occurs.},

Seven countries have â€˜coldspotsâ€™ where vaccine coverage is below the WHO target of 80\%. Over 14 million children under 5 years of age live in coldspots across the region, and a total of 8â€“12 million children are unvaccinated. Spatial patterns of vaccination do not map directly onto sub-national administrative units and transnational coldspots exist. Clustering of low vaccination areas may allow for pockets of susceptibility that sustain circulation despite high overall coverage.

Moreover, agricultural production, generally the main economic activity in rural areas of developing countries, is risky, affected by droughts and floods. Due to poverty and the limited availability of crop insurance, rural households often rely on distant family members to provide money for buying food, starting a business or maintaining an existing business. The vast majority of moves happen within countries. Focusing on developing regions, this Roundup addresses the following questions: What are the broad trends in internal migration? Do internal migrants and their families really benefit from within-country mobility? What role does internal migration play in the recent urbanization process?

	abstract = {Incidence of whooping cough, unlike many other childhood diseases for which there is an efficacious vaccine, has been increasing over the past twenty years despite high levels of vaccine coverage. Its reemergence has been particularly noticeable among teenagers and adults. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain these two patterns, but parsimonious reconciliation of clinical data on the limited duration of immunity with both pre- and postvaccine era age-specific incidence remains a challenge. We consider the immunologically relevant, yet epidemiologically largely neglected, possibility that a primed immune system can respond to a lower dose of antigen than a naive one. We hypothesize that during the prevaccine era teenagersâ€™ and adultsâ€™ primed immunity was frequently boosted by reexposure, so maintaining herd immunity in the face of potentially eroding individual immunity. In contrast, low pathogen circulation in the current era, except during epidemic outbreaks, allows immunity to be lost before reexposure occurs. We develop and analyze an age-structured model that encapsulates this hypothesis. We find that immune boosting must be more easily triggered than primary infection to account for age-incidence data. We make age-specific and dynamical predictions through bifurcation analysis and simulation. The boosting model proposed here parsimoniously captures four key features of pertussis data from highly vaccinated countries: (i) the shift in age-specific incidence, (ii) reemergence with high vaccine coverage, (iii) the possibility for cyclic dynamics in the pre- and postvaccine eras, and (iv) the apparent shift from susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)-like to susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS)-like phenomenology of infection and immunity to Bordetella pertussis.},

	abstract = {Pertussis incidence has been rising in some countries, including the UK, despite sustained high vaccine coverage. We questioned whether it is possible to explain the resurgence without recourse to complex hypotheses about pathogen evolution, subclinical infections, or trends in surveillance efficiency. In particular, we investigated the possibility that the resurgence is a consequence of the legacy of incomplete pediatric immunization, in the context of cohort structure and age-dependent transmission. We constructed a model of pertussis transmission in England and Wales based on data on age-specific contact rates and historical vaccine coverage estimates. We evaluated the agreement between model-predicted and observed patterns of age-specific pertussis incidence under a variety of assumptions regarding the duration of immunity. Under the assumption that infection-derived immunity is complete and lifelong, and regardless of the duration of vaccine-induced immunity, the model consistently predicts a resurgence of pertussis incidence comparable to that which has been observed. Interestingly, no resurgence is predicted when infection- and vaccine-derived immunities wane at the same rate. These results were qualitatively insensitive to rates of primary vaccine failure. We conclude that the alarming resurgence of pertussis among adults and adolescents in Britain and elsewhere may simply be a legacy of historically inadequate coverage employing imperfect vaccines. Indeed, we argue that the absence of resurgence at this late date would be more surprising. Our analysis shows that careful accounting for age dependence in contact rates and susceptibility is prerequisite to the identification of which features of pertussis epidemiology want additional explanation.},

Historic records are an invaluable source of information in this enterprise. Pertussis (whooping cough) is a re-emerging infection whose intermittent bouts of large multiannual epidemics interspersed between periods of smaller-amplitude cycles remain an enigma. It has been suggested that recent increases in pertussis incidence and shifts in the age-distribution of cases may be due to diminished natural immune boosting. Here we show that a model that incorporates this mechanism can account for a unique set of pre-vaccine-era data from Copenhagen. Under this model, immune boosting induces transient bursts of large amplitude outbreaks. In the face of mass vaccination, the boosting model predicts larger and more frequent outbreaks than do models with permanent or passively-waning immunity.

To understand the epidemiological implications of some of these different modes, we performed a systematic analysis of a model based on the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered equations with a vaccinated component that permits vaccine failure in degree (``leakiness''), take (``all-or-nothingness''), and duration (waning of vaccine-derived immunity). The model was first considered as a system of ordinary differential equations and then extended to a system of partial differential equations to accommodate age structure. We derived analytic expressions for the steady states of the system and the final age distributions in the case of homogenous contact rates. The stability of these equilibria are determined by a threshold parameter \$R\_p\$, a function of the vaccine failure parameters and the coverage \$p\$. The value of \$p\$ for which \$R\_p=1\$ yields the critical vaccination ratio, a measure of herd immunity. Using this concept, we can compare vaccines that confer the same level of herd immunity to the population but may fail at the individual level in different ways. For any fixed \$R\_p{\textgreater}1\$, the leaky model results in the highest prevalence of infection, while the all-or-nothing and waning models have the same steady state prevalence. The actual composition of a vaccine cannot be determined on the basis of steady state levels alone, but the distinctions can be made by looking at transient dynamics (such as after the onset of vaccination), the mean age of infection, the age distributions at steady state of the infected class, and the effect of age-specific contact rates.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
The resurgence of pertussis in some countries that maintain high vaccination coverage has drawn attention to gaps in our understanding of the epidemiological effects of pertussis vaccines. In particular, major questions surround the nature, degree and durability of vaccine protection. To address these questions, we used mechanistic transmission models to examine regional time series incidence data from Italy in the period immediately following the introduction of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine. Our results concur with recent animal-challenge experiments wherein infections in aP-vaccinated individuals proved as transmissible as those in naive individuals but much less symptomatic. On the other hand, the data provide evidence for vaccine-driven reduction in susceptibility, which we quantify via a synthetic measure of vaccine impact. As to the precise nature of vaccine failure, the data do not allow us to distinguish between leakiness and waning of vaccine immunity, or some combination of these. Across the range of well-supported models, the nature and duration of vaccine protection, the age profile of incidence and the range of projected epidemiological futures differ substantially, underscoring the importance of the remaining unknowns. We identify key data gaps: sources of data that can supply the information needed to eliminate these remaining uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Pertussis, a highly contagious respiratory infection, remains a public health priority despite the availability of vaccines for 70 years. Still a leading cause of mortality in developing countries, pertussis has re-emerged in several developed countries with high vaccination coverage. Resurgence of pertussis in these countries has routinely been attributed to increased awareness of the disease, imperfect vaccinal protection or high infection rates in adults. In this review, we first present 1980â€“2012 incidence data from 63 countries and show that pertussis resurgence is not universal. We further argue that the large geographical variation in trends probably precludes a simple explanation, such as the transition from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines. Reviewing available evidence, we then propose that prevailing views on pertussis epidemiology are inconsistent with both historical and contemporary data. Indeed, we summarize epidemiological evidence showing that natural infection and vaccination both appear to provide long-term protection against transmission and disease, so that previously infected or vaccinated adults contribute little to overall transmission at a population level. Finally, we identify several promising avenues that may lead to a consistent explanation of global pertussis epidemiology and to more effective control strategies.},

We compared maternal antibody decay of two groups of children: those whose mothers were 25 years old or more (mothers born in the pre-vaccination era), and less than 25 years old (mothers born in the vaccination era). Therefore, the 25-year-age cut-off was chosen to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mothers. We also compared the immunogenicity of measles vaccine in children from 6 to 12 months of age, in these two groups and also according to their motherâ€™s serostatus. The optimal age of vaccination for a routine program was estimated by means of mathematical models.
This study was carried out in a sample of 1216 mothers and their respective children. Our results indicate that the optimal age for vaccination of the whole sample was 15 months, 17 months for children born from older mothers, 14 months for children born from younger mothers, 17 months for children born from seropositive mothers and 12 months for children born from seronegative mothers. Therefore, a change to an earlier age of routine vaccination is not justified by our results.},

As a result the Global Vaccine Action Plan, endorsed by the World Health Assembly, has targeted measles elimination in at least five of the six World Health Organisation Regions by 2020. This is an ambitious goal, since measles control requires the highest immunisation coverage of any vaccine preventable disease, which means that the health system must be able to reach every community. Further, while measles remains endemic in any country, importations will result in local transmission and outbreaks in countries and Regions that have interrupted local endemic measles circulation. One of the lines of evidence that countries and Regions must address to confirm measles elimination is a detailed description of measles epidemiology over an extended period. This information is incredibly valuable as predictable epidemiological patterns emerge as measles elimination is approached and achieved. These critical features, including the source, size and duration of outbreaks, the seasonality and age-distribution of cases, genotyping pointers and effective reproduction rate estimates, are discussed with illustrative examples from the Region of the Americas, which eliminated measles in 2002, and the Western Pacific Region, which has established a Regional Verification Commission to review progress towards elimination in all member countries.},

More than 50,000 samples were tested for measles and 86.4\% of the confirmed cases had a laboratory diagnosis. The beginning of an campaign vaccination was delayed in part by the availability of vaccine. The classic control measures were not enough to control the epidemic. The creation of a committee of experts, the agreement signed between managers of the three spheres of government, the conducting of an institutional active search of suspected cases, vaccination door to door at alternative times, the use of micro planning, a broad advertising campaign at local media and technical operative support contributed to containing the epidemic. It is important to recognize the possibility of epidemics at this stage of post-elimination and prepare a sensitive surveillance system for timely response.},

We conducted a community survey in Espindola, a rural border community in northern Peru, following a measles outbreak and subsequent ORI to study the epidemiology and impact of the outbreak and to evaluate the costs and benefits of measles ORI. During the outbreak, 150 of the 553 Espindola residents developed clinical cases of measles. Adults accounted for 44.0\% of cases, and were frequently identified as primary cases. The attack rate among all susceptible people was 45.5\% and was highest (61.2\%) for the 16-20 year age group. Among adults, significant risk factors for developing measles included being aged 16-20 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.06, 95\% CI = 2.08, 4.49) and being male (RR = 1.73, 95\% CI = 1.11, 2.71). Among serologically confirmed cases, 60.7\% developed diarrhoea and 32.1\% pneumonia. The overall case-fatality rate was 3.3\%, but reached 19.1\% in the 0-23-month age group. Failure to reach children through either routine immunization or national campaigns made this community vulnerable to the severe and extensive impact of measles virus importation. The ORI campaign targeted non-measles case children aged 6 months to 15 years, regardless of their previous immunization status, and was effective in terminating this measles outbreak and in preventing morbidity, loss of livelihood and death despite the involvement of large numbers of adults in measles transmission. The last measles case occurred within 3 weeks of completing ORI. The ORI campaign, which would have cost approximately US\$ 3000 in 1998, saved as many as 1155 person-days of work among 77 adults, prevented an estimated 87 cases of diarrhoea and 46 cases of pneumonia, and averted 5 deaths.},

Pregnancy continued in 40\%, and the infants were followed up after birth both clinically and serologically. The frequency of congenital infection after maternal rubella with a rash was more than 80\% during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, 54\% at 13-14 weeks, and 25\% at the end of the second trimester. The infection rate then rose again to reach a high figure in the last month. Follow-up was to 2 years of ageâ€”the findings in infected children being compared with those in children who had escaped infection. Rubella defects occurred in all infants infected before the 11th week (principally congenital heart disease and deafness) and in 35\% of those infected at 13-16 weeks (deafness alone). No defects attributable to rubella were found in 63 children infected after 16 weeks. Continued surveillance of cases of confirmed rubella during pregnancy is recommended as an additional way of monitoring the effect of rubella vaccination.},

Design: Retrospective survey and systematic review.
Setting: Greece (population 10 million), 1950-95.
Subjects: Children, adolescents, and women of childbearing age.
Results: Around 1975 in Greece the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine started being given to boys and girls aged 1 year without policies to attain high vaccination coverage and to protect adolescents and young women During the 1980s, vaccination coverage for rubella remained consistently below 50\%, and the proportion of pregnant women susceptible to rubella gradually increased. In 1993 the incidence of rubella in young adults was higher than in any previous epidemic year. The epidemic of congenital rubella that followed, with 25 serologically confirmed cases (24.6 per 100 000 live births), was probably the largest such epidemic in Greece after 1950.
Conclusions: With low vaccination coverage, the immunisation of boys and girls aged 1 year against rubella carries the theoretical risk of increasing the occurrence of congenital rubella. This phenomenon, which has not been previously reported, occurred in Greece.

	abstract = {Scientists first isolated Zika virus in 1947, but the disease it caused in humans was considered mild: It did nothing to 80\% of the people it infected, and the ones who had symptoms only had temporary fevers and rashes. But last year, a high number of cases of brain-damaging microcephaly in newborns began to surface in Brazil in lockstep with the arrival of the Zika virus, which is spread by mosquitoes. The World Health Organization on 1 February declared these clusters of disease a "public health emergency of international concern," and a rush of vaccinemakers has jumped into the race to develop a preventive. Vaccines exist against several other flaviviruses, the family Zika belongs to, and experts predict that this won't be a major scientific challenge. They also say it may be possible to piggyback on the other flavivirus vaccines, like ones made for dengue and yellow fever. Then again, vaccine R\&D takes time, and because this effort is starting from scratch, researchers say it will take at least a few years before a vaccine can prove itself safe and effective in large human efficacy studies.
Researchers see many approachesâ€”but a vaccine likely will take years.

	abstract = {Objective. To estimate the number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections among US children younger than 10 years before implementation of routine childhood hepatitis B immunization.
Methods. Incidence of HBV infection in children was modeled from existing prevalence data by means of regression analysis. Sources of data for the models included published and unpublished surveys that determined the prevalence of HBV infection in US-born children. The number of nonperinatal HBV infections in children younger than 10 years was estimated by applying these infection rates to 1991 population data according to maternal race, ethnicity, and birthplace.
Results. Estimated annual rates of infection ranged from 24 per 100 000 in non-Asian children to 2580 per 100 000 in children of Southeast Asian immigrant mothers. These rates indicate that by the early 1990s, HBV was infecting 16 000 children who were younger than 10 years (8700 non-Asian children and 7300 Asian-American children) annually. The total estimate, not including perinatal infections, ranged from 12 000 (95\% confidence interval: 5500â€“27 700) to 24 900 (95\% confidence interval: 16 700â€“42 300) infections and depended on how the estimated rates were applied to the population data.
Conclusion. Thousands of US children were infected each year with HBV before routine infant hepatitis B immunization, placing them at high risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma later in life.},

Now, the availability of well characterized malarial antigens allows us to test whether serological measurements provide a practical method for estimating transmission.

	abstract = {Objective. The high prevalence of antibody to hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the US population suggests that the incidence of infection is much higher than reported, but the infection rate is difficult to measure directly because of anicteric infection and underreporting. We present a model that reconciles the reported incidence of hepatitis A with the observed prevalence of antibody to HAV and provides an estimate of the true incidence of HAV infection.
Methods. In the model, reported incidence of hepatitis A in the United States was adjusted to account first for anicteric infection and then for underreporting and declining incidence over time such that the prevalence predicted by the model approximated that observed in 2 nationwide surveys.
Results. The model showed incidence in the susceptible population declining by 4.5\% per year. As incidence declined early in the 1900s, the average age at infection increased, leading to a paradoxical increase in the incidence of icteric infection followed by a slow decline. The model estimated approximately 270 000 (range: 190 000â€“360 000) infections annually from 1980 to 1999, 10.4 times the number of hepatitis A cases actually reported during this period. More than half of these infections occurred in children who were younger than 10 years, most of which would have been clinically unrecognizable as hepatitis.
Conclusions. These results suggest a large reservoir of infection in children and that interruption of transmission in children may substantially reduce incidence of hepatitis A overall.},

	abstract = {Background This study aimed to identify the transmission pattern of hepatitis A (HA) infection based on a primary dataset from the Brazilian National Hepatitis Survey in a pre-vaccination context. The national survey conducted in urban areas disclosed two epidemiological scenarios with low and intermediate HA endemicity.  Methods A catalytic model of HA transmission was built based on a national seroprevalence survey (2005 to 2009). The seroprevalence data from 7,062 individuals aged 5â€“69 years from all the Brazilian macro-regions were included. We built up three models: fully homogeneous mixing model, with constant contact pattern; the highly assortative model and the highly assortative model with the additional component accounting for contacts with infected food/water. Curves of prevalence, force of infection (FOI) and the number of new infections with 99\% confidence intervals (CIs) were compared between the intermediate (North, Northeast, Midwest and Federal District) and low (South and Southeast) endemicity areas. A contour plot was also constructed.  Results The anti- HAV IgG seroprevalence was 68.8\% (95\% CI, 64.8\%â€“72.5\%) and 33.7\% (95\% CI, 32.4\%â€“35.1\%) for the intermediate and low endemicity areas, respectively, according to the field data analysis. The models showed that a higher force of infection was identified in the 10- to 19-year-old age cohort (âˆ¼9,000 infected individuals per year per 100,000 susceptible persons) in the intermediate endemicity area, whereas a higher force of infection occurred in the 15- to 29-year-old age cohort (âˆ¼6,000 infected individuals per year per 100,000 susceptible persons) for the other macro-regions.  Conclusion Our findings support the shift of Brazil toward intermediate and low endemicity levels with the shift of the risk of infection to older age groups. These estimates of HA force of infection stratified by age and endemicity levels are useful information to characterize the pre-vaccination scenario in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Background With low and markedly seasonal malaria transmission, increasingly sensitive tools for better stratifying the risk of infection and targeting control interventions are needed. A cross-sectional survey to characterize the current malaria transmission patterns, identify hotspots, and detect recent changes using parasitological and serological measures was conducted in three sites of the Peruvian Amazon.   Material and Methods After full census of the study population, 651 participants were interviewed, clinically examined and had a blood sample taken for the detection of malaria parasites (microscopy and PCR) and antibodies against P. vivax (PvMSP119, PvAMA1) and P. falciparum (PfGLURP, PfAMA1) antigens by ELISA. Risk factors for malaria infection (positive PCR) and malaria exposure (seropositivity) were assessed by multivariate survey logistic regression models. Age-specific seroprevalence was analyzed using a reversible catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood for generating seroconversion rates (SCR, Î»). SaTScan was used to detect spatial clusters of serology-positive individuals within each site.   Results The overall parasite prevalence by PCR was low, i.e. 3.9\% for P. vivax and 6.7\% for P. falciparum, while the seroprevalence was substantially higher, 33.6\% for P. vivax and 22.0\% for P. falciparum, with major differences between study sites. Age and location (site) were significantly associated with P. vivax exposure; while location, age and outdoor occupation were associated with P. falciparum exposure. P. falciparum seroprevalence curves showed a stable transmission throughout time, while for P. vivax transmission was better described by a model with two SCRs. The spatial analysis identified well-defined clusters of P. falciparum seropositive individuals in two sites, while it detected only a very small cluster of P. vivax exposure.   Conclusion The use of a single parasitological and serological malaria survey has proven to be an efficient and accurate method to characterize the species specific heterogeneity in malaria transmission at micro-geographical level as well as to identify recent changes in transmission.},

We incorporated a bead coupled with recombinant SAG2A protein into our Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) multiplex bead assay (MBA) panel and used it to determine Toxoplasma infection rates in two studies in Haiti. In a longitudinal cohort study of children aged 0â€“11 years, the infection rate varied with age reaching a maximum of 0Â·131 infections/year in children aged 3 years [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0Â·065â€“0Â·204]. The median time to seroconversion was estimated to be 9Â·7 years (95\% CI 7Â·6â€“âˆž). In a cross-sectional, community-wide survey of residents of all ages, we determined an overall seroprevalence of 28Â·2\%. The seroprevalence age curve from the cross-sectional study also suggested that the force of infection varied with age and peaked at 0Â·057 infections/year (95\% CI 0Â·033â€“0Â·080) at age 2Â·6 years. Integration of the Toxoplasma MBA into NTD surveys may allow for better estimates of the potential burden of congenital toxoplasmosis in underserved regions.},

Incidence of malaria in the control group of a trial or in a cohort study can be used but is difficult to interpret and to compare between different places and between age groups because of differences in levels of acquired immunity. The reversible catalytic model has been developed to estimate malaria transmission intensity using age-stratified serological data.

	abstract = {Quantifying the factors that predict parasite outbreak and persistence is a major challenge for both applied and fundamental biology. Key to understanding parasite prevalence and disease outbreaks is determining at what age individuals show signs of infection, and whether or not they recover. Age-dependent patterns of the infection of a host population by parasites can indicate among-individual heterogeneities in their susceptibility to, or rate of recovery from, parasite infections. Here, we present a cross-sectional study of avian malaria in a long-lived bird species, the mute swan Cygnus olor, examining age-related patterns of parasite prevalence and modelling patterns of infection and recovery. One-hundred and fifteen swans, ranging from one to nineteen years old, were screened for infection with Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon parasites. Infections with three cytochrome-b lineages of Haemoproteus were found (pooled prevalence 67\%), namely WW1 (26\%), which is common in passerine birds, and two new lineages closely related to WW1: MUTSW1 (25\%) and MUTSW2 (16\%). We found evidence for age-related infection in one lineage, MUTSW1. Catalytic models examining patterns of infection and recovery in the population suggested that infections in this population were not life-long â€“ recovery of individuals was included in the best fitting models. These findings support the results of recent studies that suggest hosts can clear infections, although patterns of infection-related mortality in older birds remain to be studied in more detail.},

	abstract = {Background The burden of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) is typically underestimated in routine surveillance. Updated estimates are needed following the recent WHO position paper on rubella and recent GAVI initiatives, funding rubella vaccination in eligible countries. Previous estimates considered the year 1996 and only 78 (developing) countries.   Methods We reviewed the literature to identify rubella seroprevalence studies conducted before countries introduced rubella-containing vaccination (RCV). These data and the estimated vaccination coverage in the routine schedule and mass campaigns were incorporated in mathematical models to estimate the CRS incidence in 1996 and 2000â€“2010 for each country, region and globally.   Results The estimated CRS decreased in the three regions (Americas, Europe and Eastern Mediterranean) which had introduced widespread RCV by 2010, reaching {\textless}2 per 100,000 live births (the Americas and Europe) and 25 (95\% CI 4â€“61) per 100,000 live births (the Eastern Mediterranean). The estimated incidence in 2010 ranged from 90 (95\% CI: 46â€“195) in the Western Pacific, excluding China, to 116 (95\% CI: 56â€“235) and 121 (95\% CI: 31â€“238) per 100,000 live births in Africa and SE Asia respectively. Highest numbers of cases were predicted in Africa (39,000, 95\% CI: 18,000â€“80,000) and SE Asia (49,000, 95\% CI: 11,000â€“97,000). In 2010, 105,000 (95\% CI: 54,000â€“158,000) CRS cases were estimated globally, compared to 119,000 (95\% CI: 72,000â€“169,000) in 1996.   Conclusions Whilst falling dramatically in the Americas, Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean after vaccination, the estimated CRS incidence remains high elsewhere. Well-conducted seroprevalence studies can help to improve the reliability of these estimates and monitor the impact of rubella vaccination.},

High initial vector density, poor housing material, peridomestic infestation, insecticide resistance, and a lack of systematic insecticide spraying and vector surveillance have previously been incriminated for failure to interrupt and sustain interruption of transmission. We conducted a census, seroprevalence, and epidemiologic study in a rural area in the Bolivian Chaco. The prevalence of infection was almost 20\% in children and over 80\% in adults. We estimated the intensity of transmission over time based on infection prevalence by age. We found that after the first spray program, transmission appeared to fall transiently but then increased again quickly. Sleeping in a structure with cracks in the walls, age and village of residence were associated with increased likelihood of infection. These findings suggest that consistently repeated systematic spraying campaigns accompanied by housing improvements are necessary to interrupt and sustain interruption of vector-borne transmission.},

The regular oscillations of the number of cases around the average endemic level has attracted the attention of epidemiologists and mathematicians alike, In particular, the two-year period of measles in some large communities has been the object of many attempts of explanation in terms of deterministic and stochastic models, Soperâ€™s [1] deterministic approach produced damped oscillations in contrast to the observations, Bartlett [2] suggested that a stochastic version of Soperâ€™s model was more realistic, (See also Bailey [3], Chap, 7.) London and Yorke [4] however were able to obtain undamped oscillations with periods of one and two years using a deterministic model which includes a latent period between the time of infection and the beginning of the infectious period, From their simulations they conclude that the length of the latent period has to be within a small range for the occurrence of biennial outbreaks, Recently, Stirzaker [5] treated this problem from the point of view of the theory of nonlinear oscillations according to which the biennial cycles of measles epidemics could be understood as subharmonic parametric resonance.},

The two-stage model is found the most appropriate. Use of this model assumes constant rates of becoming positive and of becoming negative. Two separate analyses are required, one for the first few years of life of the human host and one for the remainder. Satisfactory fits to the data are obtained only when the proportion of older people who remain positive is determined. This proportion varies with the intensity of transmission., The calculated rates of becoming positive agree very well with rates obtained by observing originally negative children for 12 months or longer., The parameters in the model are used in interpreting data from skin-test surveys. It is concluded tentatively that in order to be positive by the skin test, a person must have had both sexes of worms at some time in the past and to be carrying living female worms or to have been exposed recently to female cercariae., It may become possible to use the model to predict the entire age-prevalence curve from data on children, thus saving much effort in parasitological surveys.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
The emergence of Zika virus in the Americas has coincided with increased reports of babies born with microcephaly. On Feb 1, 2016, WHO declared the suspected link between Zika virus and microcephaly to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This association, however, has not been precisely quantified.
Methods
We retrospectively analysed data from a Zika virus outbreak in French Polynesia, which was the largest documented outbreak before that in the Americas. We used serological and surveillance data to estimate the probability of infection with Zika virus for each week of the epidemic and searched medical records to identify all cases of microcephaly from September, 2013, to July, 2015. Simple models were used to assess periods of risk in pregnancy when Zika virus might increase the risk of microcephaly and estimate the associated risk.
Findings
The Zika virus outbreak began in October, 2013, and ended in April, 2014, and 66\% (95\% CI 62â€“70) of the general population were infected. Of the eight microcephaly cases identified during the 23-month study period, seven (88\%) occurred in the 4-month period March 1 to July 10, 2014. The timing of these cases was best explained by a period of risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. In this model, the baseline prevalence of microcephaly was two cases (95\% CI 0â€“8) per 10â€ˆ000 neonates, and the risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection was 95 cases (34â€“191) per 10â€ˆ000 women infected in the first trimester. We could not rule out an increased risk of microcephaly from infection in other trimesters, but models that excluded the first trimester were not supported by the data.
Interpretation
Our findings provide a quantitative estimate of the risk of microcephaly in fetuses and neonates whose mothers are infected with Zika virus.

	abstract = {Background Despite a safe and effective vaccine, rubella vaccination programs with inadequate coverage can raise the average age of rubella infection; thereby increasing rubella cases among pregnant women and the resulting congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in their newborns. The vaccination coverage necessary to reduce CRS depends on the birthrate in a country and the reproductive number, R0, a measure of how efficiently a disease transmits. While the birthrate within a country can be known with some accuracy, R0 varies between settings and can be difficult to measure. Here we aim to provide guidance on the safe introduction of rubella vaccine into countries in the face of substantial uncertainty in R0.  Methods We estimated the distribution of R0 in African countries based on the age distribution of rubella infection using Bayesian hierarchical models. We developed an age specific model of rubella transmission to predict the level of R0 that would result in an increase in CRS burden for specific birth rates and coverage levels. Combining these results, we summarize the safety of introducing rubella vaccine across demographic and coverage contexts.  Findings The median R0 of rubella in the African region is 5.2, with 90\% of countries expected to have an R0 between 4.0 and 6.7. Overall, we predict that countries maintaining routine vaccination coverage of 80\% or higher are can be confident in seeing a reduction in CRS over a 30 year time horizon.  Conclusions Under realistic assumptions about human contact, our results suggest that even in low birth rate settings high vaccine coverage must be maintained to avoid an increase in CRS. These results lend further support to the WHO recommendation that countries reach 80\% coverage for measles vaccine before introducing rubella vaccination, and highlight the importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage once the vaccine is introduced.},

However, this relationship assumes that the infection has reached an endemic equilibrium. In reality, most infectious diseases exhibit seasonal and/or long-term oscillations in incidence. We use a seasonally-forced age-structured SIR model to explore the relationship between the number of cases and the average age of first infection over a single epidemic cycle. Contrary to the relationship for the equilibrium dynamics, we find that the average age of first infection is greatest at or near the peak of the epidemic when mixing is homogeneous. We explore the sensitivity of our findings to assumptions about the natural history of infection, population mixing behavior, the mechanism of seasonality, and of the timing of case reporting in relation to the infectious period. We conclude that seasonal variation in the average age of first infection tends to be greatest for acute infections, and the relationship between the number of cases and the average age of first infection can vary depending on the nature of population mixing and the natural history of infection.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYMeasles elimination goals have been adopted in a range of countries, sub-regions, and regions since the WHO declared an elimination goal by 2015 or 2020. All countries attempt to achieve and maintain high coverage through routine immunization programmes. This routine strategy, however, does not ensure the elimination goal of measles. Many developed countries, such as the United States, that have succeeded in interrupting measles transmission earlier, are now experiencing outbreaks with an increasing number of cases. Using a stochastic, age-structured model of measles vaccination dynamics, we explore and characterize the transient dynamics of measles susceptibility in the years following the implementation of routine vaccination at the herd immunity threshold. We demonstrate how a population could face risks of potentially large outbreaks even within few years of vaccination. We characterize different risk profiles depending on the incidence pattern in the years prior to vaccination. These results suggest that the classic critical vaccination threshold is necessary to achieve herd immunity, but not sufficient to prevent long periods of transient, super-critical dynamics. Our results suggest the need of future work for more careful monitoring of the impacts of current immunization programmes, and developing models that take into account more complicated vaccination strategies, demographic factors, and population movements.},

The components of the national plan included conducting a national vaccination campaign with a single dose of MR vaccine for men and women aged 15â€“39 years, establishing routine postpartum MR vaccination of all previously unvaccinated women, maintaining high coverage among children with two doses of measlesâ€mumpsâ€rubella vaccine, strengthening the integrated measles and rubella surveillance system, and developing a CRS surveillance system.

The recent explosive outbreak of ZIKV in South America has led to widespread concern, with reports of neurological sequelae ranging from Guillain BarrÃ© syndrome to microcephaly. ZIKV infection has occurred in areas previously exposed to dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus closely related to ZIKV. Here we investigated the serological cross-reaction between the two viruses. Plasma immune to DENV showed substantial cross-reaction to ZIKV and was able to drive antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection. Using a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to DENV, we showed that most antibodies that reacted to DENV envelope protein also reacted to ZIKV. Antibodies to linear epitopes, including the immunodominant fusion-loop epitope, were able to bind ZIKV but were unable to neutralize the virus and instead promoted ADE. Our data indicate that immunity to DENV might drive greater ZIKV replication and have clear implications for disease pathogenesis and future vaccine programs for ZIKV and DENV.},

	abstract = {SummaryObjectives
Zika virus has spread internationally through countries in the South Pacific and Americas. The present study aimed to estimate the basic reproduction number, R0, of Zika virus infection as a measurement of the transmission potential, reanalyzing past epidemic data from the South Pacific.
Methods
Incidence data from two epidemics, one on Yap Island, Federal State of Micronesia in 2007 and the other in French Polynesia in 2013â€“2014, were reanalyzed. R0 of Zika virus infection was estimated from the early exponential growth rate of these two epidemics.
Results
The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of R0 for the Yap Island epidemic was in the order of 4.3â€“5.8 with broad uncertainty bounds due to the small sample size of confirmed and probable cases. The MLE of R0 for French Polynesia based on syndromic data ranged from 1.8 to 2.0 with narrow uncertainty bounds.
Conclusions
The transmissibility of Zika virus infection appears to be comparable to those of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Considering that Aedes species are a shared vector, this finding indicates that Zika virus replication within the vector is perhaps comparable to dengue and chikungunya.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01422},
	abstract = {Background: In 2015, the Zika arbovirus (ZIKV) began circulating in the Americas, rapidly expanding its global geographic range in explosive outbreaks. Unusual among mosquito-borne diseases, ZIKV has been shown to also be sexually transmitted, although sustained autochthonous transmission due to sexual transmission alone has not been observed, indicating the reproduction number (R0) for sexual transmission alone is less than 1. Critical to the assessment of outbreak risk, estimation of the potential attack rates, and assessment of control measures, are estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0. Methods: We estimated the R0 of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, through an analysis of the exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases (n=359 to the end of November, 2015). Findings: The rate of exponential rise in cases was rho=0.076 days-1, with 95 percent CI [0.066,0.087] days-1. We used a vector-borne disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate the R0; assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we estimated the total R0=3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to sexual transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95 percent confidence. Interpretation: This is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, and also among the first quantifications of the relative impact of sexual transmission.},

Understanding the role of primary vaccine failure (failure to seroconvert after vaccination) and secondary vaccine failures (waning immunity after seroconversion) in measles epidemics is important for the evaluation of measles control programs in developing countries. After a measles epidemic in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, 159 cases previously confirmed by detection of specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were tested for IgG avidity, and a secondary immune response, defined by an IgG avidity index of at least 30\%, was established in 30 of 159 (18.9\%) patients. Among the 159 patients, 107 (67.3\%) had not been vaccinated and 52 (32.7\%) had received one or more doses of measles vaccine. Of the 107 unvaccinated patients, 104 (97.2\%) showed a primary immune response, defined as an IgG avidity index of less than 30\%. Among the 52 patients with documented vaccination, 25 (48.1\%) showed a primary immune response and 27 (51.9\%) showed a secondary immune response, thereby constituting a secondary vaccine failure. Primary vaccine failure was observed in 13 of 13 patients vaccinated prior to 1 year of age and in 43.5 and 12.5\%, respectively, of patients receiving one or two doses after their first birthdays. These results provide evidence that measurement of IgG avidity can be used to distinguish between primary and secondary vaccine failures in vaccinated patients with measles; the method can also be a useful tool for the evaluation of measles control programs.},

During a ten-day period, 4,194,174 children from 9 months to 14 years old, representing 86\% of the target population, were vaccinated regardless of their previous vaccination status. Four months later, the prevalence of measles antibodies was evaluated through a random seroepidemiological survey. The survey included all children in greater SÃ£o Paulo between one month and 14 years old, irrespective of campaign participation. Blood samples were collected on filter-paper and tested for measles antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. Negative or doubtful cases were tested again using an immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). Of the 8661 samples included in the study, 8146 (94.1\%) were positive for measles antibody. In children aged one year or more a significant difference in antibody prevalence was observed when comparing those who were vaccinated during the mass immunization (98.0\%) with those who did not participate in the campaign (91.3\%). In addition, after the immunization, a marked and immediate decrease was observed in incidence rates for measles cases notified to the State Secretary of Health, falling from 222/100,000 inhabitants in 1987 to 2.7/100,000 in 1988. These data suggest that mass immunization can serve as an additional strategy for the rapid control of measles in developing countries.},

Standard methods to estimate age-specific rates assume that the age-specific force of infection is constant in time. However, this assumption may easily be violated in the face of a highly variable outbreak history, as recently observed for acute immunizing infections like measles, in strongly seasonal settings. Here we investigate the biases that result from ignoring such fluctuations in incidence and present a correction based on the epidemic history. We apply the method to data from a measles outbreak in Niamey, Niger and show that, despite a bimodal age distribution of cases, the estimated age-specific force of infection is unimodal and concentrated in young children ({\textless}5 years) consistent with previous analyses of age-specific rates in the region.},

In East Africa the force of measles infection appears to be independent of age, probably as a result of sociocultural factors. Consequently the incidence of measles is highest in the second half of the first year of life and decreases with increasing age. Major vaccination efforts will raise the average age of measles attack, but the peak incidence will remain in the first year of life. This complicates the decision on the optimal age for vaccination and the need for incidence surveillance is stressed.
The simple catalytic model, which is based on the assumption of an age-independent force of infection may play an important role in measles surveillance. With this model simple and economic surveillance studies could be designed which use cross-sectional data only.},

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by measles virus and is one of the most devastating infectious diseases of manâ€”measles was responsible for millions of deaths annually worldwide before the introduction of the measles vaccines. Remarkable progress in reducing the number of people dying from measles has been made through measles vaccination, with an estimated 164â€ˆ000 deaths attributed to measles in 2008. This achievement attests to the enormous importance of measles vaccination to public health. However, this progress is threatened by failure to maintain high levels of measles vaccine coverage. Recent measles outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the USA show the ease with which measles virus can re-enter communities if high levels of population immunity are not sustained. The major challenges for continued measles control and eventual eradication will be logistical, financial, and the garnering of sufficient political will. These challenges need to be met to ensure that future generations of children do not die of measles.},

With no vaccine or treatment commercially available, understanding the underlying factors linked to virus exposure is critical for developing more effective dengue interventions. We conducted a study in an endemic region of Thailand where transmission is high and children are expected to be the non-immune, amplifying portion of the host population. We examined  Ae. aegypti  feeding patterns and risk by matching human DNA profiles in blood-fed mosquitoes to study area residents. A small number of meals matched people from the study area, suggesting that mosquitoes feed on people moving transiently through communities. People under 25 years of age were bitten less frequently than older people. We constructed network models to explore the presence of mosquito feeding â€œhotspotsâ€ and detected a local market â€œhotspotâ€ in one study village during the high dengue transmission season. Our results provide new details on dengue vector feeding patterns and highlight the need to conduct integrated studies of vector feeding and human behavior, and virus transmission patterns in order to better understand the dengue transmission efficiency and spread.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) recently established a global stockpile of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) to be preferentially used in epidemic response (reactive campaigns) with any vaccine remaining after 1 year allocated to endemic settings. Hence, the number of cholera cases or deaths prevented in an endemic setting represents the minimum utility of these doses, and the optimal risk-averse response to any reactive vaccination request (i.e. the minimax strategy) is one that allocates the remaining doses between the requested epidemic response and endemic use in order to ensure that at least this minimum utility is achieved. Using mathematical models, we find that the best minimax strategy is to allocate the majority of doses to reactive campaigns, unless the request came late in the targeted epidemic. As vaccine supplies dwindle, the case for reactive use of the remaining doses grows stronger. Our analysis provides a lower bound for the amount of OCV to keep in reserve when responding to any request. These results provide a strategic context for the fulfilment of requests to the stockpile, and define allocation strategies that minimize the number of OCV doses that are allocated to suboptimal situations.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that a key component of successful infection control efforts is understanding the complex, two-way interaction between disease dynamics and human behavioral and social dynamics. Human behavior such as contact precautions and social distancing clearly influence disease prevalence, but disease prevalence can in turn alter human behavior, forming a coupled, nonlinear system. Moreover, in many cases, the spatial structure of the population cannot be ignored, such that social and behavioral processes and/or transmission of infection must be represented with complex networks. Research on studying coupled diseaseâ€“behavior dynamics in complex networks in particular is growing rapidly, and frequently makes use of analysis methods and concepts from statistical physics. Here, we review some of the growing literature in this area. We contrast network-based approaches to homogeneous-mixing approaches, point out how their predictions differ, and describe the rich and often surprising behavior of diseaseâ€“behavior dynamics on complex networks, and compare them to processes in statistical physics. We discuss how these models can capture the dynamics that characterize many real-world scenarios, thereby suggesting ways that policy makers can better design effective prevention strategies. We also describe the growing sources of digital data that are facilitating research in this area. Finally, we suggest pitfalls which might be faced by researchers in the field, and we suggest several ways in which the field could move forward in the coming years.},

	abstract = {The global reduction of the burden of morbidity and mortality owing to measles has been a major triumph of public health. However, the continued persistence of measles infection probably not only reflects local variation in progress towards vaccination target goals, but may also reflect local variation in dynamic processes of transmission, susceptible replenishment through births and stochastic local extinction. Dynamic models predict that vaccination should increase the mean age of infection and increase inter-annual variability in incidence. Through a comparative approach, we assess national-level patterns in the mean age of infection and measles persistence. We find that while the classic predictions do hold in general, the impact of vaccination on the age distribution of cases and stochastic fadeout are mediated by local birth rate. Thus, broad-scale vaccine coverage goals are unlikely to have the same impact on the interruption of measles transmission in all demographic settings. Indeed, these results suggest that the achievement of further measles reduction or elimination goals is likely to require programmatic and vaccine coverage goals that are tailored to local demographic conditions.},

	abstract = {The basic reproduction number â„›0 is arguably the most important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology. The next-generation matrix (NGM) is the natural basis for the definition and calculation of â„›0 where finitely many different categories of individuals are recognized. We clear up confusion that has been around in the literature concerning the construction of this matrix, specifically for the most frequently used so-called compartmental models. We present a detailed easy recipe for the construction of the NGM from basic ingredients derived directly from the specifications of the model. We show that two related matrices exist which we define to be the NGM with large domain and the NGM with small domain. The three matrices together reflect the range of possibilities encountered in the literature for the characterization of â„›0. We show how they are connected and how their construction follows from the basic model ingredients, and establish that they have the same non-zero eigenvalues, the largest of which is the basic reproduction number â„›0. Although we present formal recipes based on linear algebra, we encourage the construction of the NGM by way of direct epidemiological reasoning, using the clear interpretation of the elements of the NGM and of the model ingredients. We present a selection of examples as a practical guide to our methods. In the appendix we present an elementary but complete proof that â„›0 defined as the dominant eigenvalue of the NGM for compartmental systems and the Malthusian parameter r, the real-time exponential growth rate in the early phase of an outbreak, are connected by the properties that â„›0 {\textgreater} 1 if and only if r {\textgreater} 0, and â„›0 = 1 if and only if r = 0.},

	abstract = {In November 2015, El Salvador reported their first case of Zika virus (Zv) leading to an explosive outbreak that in just two months had over 6000 suspected cases. Many communities along with national agencies initiated the process to implement control measures that ranged from vector control and the use of repellents to the suggestion of avoiding pregnancies for two years, the latter one, in response to the growing number of microcephaly cases in Brazil. In our study, we explore the impact of short term mobility between two idealized interconnected communities where disparities and violence contribute to the Zv epidemic. Using a Lagrangian modeling approach in a two-patch setting, it is shown via simulations that short term mobility may be beneficial in the control of a Zv outbreak when risk is relative low and patch disparities are not too extreme. However, when the reproductive number is too high, there seems to be no benefits. This paper is dedicated to the inauguration of the Centro de Modelamiento Matem{\textbackslash}'\{a\}tico Carlos Castillo-Ch{\textbackslash}'\{a\}vez at Universidad Francisco Gavidia in San Salvador, El Salvador.},

After its putative evolution in sub-Saharan Africa, ZIKV spread in the distant past to Asia and has probably emerged on multiple occasions into urban transmission cycles involving Aedes (Stegomyia) spp. mosquitoes and human amplification hosts, accompanied by a relatively mild dengue-like illness. The unprecedented numbers of people infected during recent outbreaks in the South Pacific and the Americas may have resulted in enough ZIKV infections to notice relatively rare congenital microcephaly and Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndromes. Another hypothesis is that phenotypic changes in Asian lineage ZIKV strains led to these disease outcomes. Here, we review potential strategies to control the ongoing outbreak through vector-centric approaches as well as the prospects for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.},

It is known that ZIKV is spread by {\textbackslash}textit\{Aedes\} mosquitoes, recent studies show that ZIKV can also be transmitted via sexual contact and cases of sexually transmitted ZIKV have been confirmed in the U.S., France, and Italy. How sexual transmission affects the spread and control of ZIKV infection is not well-understood. We presented a mathematical model to investigate the impact of mosquito-borne and sexual transmission on spread and control of ZIKV and used the model to fit the ZIKV data in Brazil, Colombia, and El Salvador. Based on the estimated parameter values, we calculated the median and confidence interval of the basic reproduction number R0=2.055 (95\% CI: 0.523-6.300), in which the distribution of the percentage of contribution by sexual transmission is 3.044 (95\% CI: 0.123-45.73). Our study indicates that R0 is most sensitive to the biting rate and mortality rate of mosquitoes while sexual transmission increases the risk of infection and epidemic size and prolongs the outbreak. In order to prevent and control the transmission of ZIKV, it must be treated as not only a mosquito-borne disease but also a sexually transmitted disease.},

	abstract = {The fight against mosquito-borne diseases is a challenge of huge public health importance. To our mind, 2015 was an extraordinary year for malaria control, due to three hot news: the Nobel Prize to Youyou Tu for the discovery of artemisinin, the development of the first vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria [i.e. RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S)], and the fall of malaria infection rates worldwide, with special reference to sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are major challenges that still deserve attention, in order to boost malaria prevention and control. Indeed, parasite strains resistant to artemisinin have been detected, and RTS,S vaccine does not offer protection against Plasmodium vivax malaria, which predominates in many countries outside of Africa. Furthermore, the recent outbreaks of Zika virus infections, occurring in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, represent the most recent of four arrivals of important arboviruses in the Western Hemisphere, over the last 20 years. Zika virus follows dengue (which slyly arrived in the hemisphere over decades and became more aggressive in the 1990s), West Nile virus (emerged in 1999) and chikungunya (emerged in 2013). Notably, there are no specific treatments for these arboviruses. The emerging scenario highlights that the effective and eco-friendly control of mosquito vectors, with special reference to highly invasive species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, is crucial. The concrete potential of screening plant species as sources of metabolites for parasitological purposes is worthy of attention, as elucidated by the Y. Tuâ€™s example. Notably, plant-borne molecules are often effective at few parts per million against Aedes, Ochlerotatus, Anopheles and Culex young instars, can be used for the rapid synthesis of mosquitocidal nanoformulations and even employed to prepare cheap repellents with low human toxicity. In addition, behaviour-based control tools relying to the employ of sound traps and the manipulation of swarming behaviour (i.e. â€œlure and killâ€ approach) are discussed. The importance of further research on the chemical cues routing mosquito swarming and mating dynamics is highlighted. Besides radiation, transgenic and symbiont-based mosquito control approaches, an effective option may be the employ of biological control agents of mosquito young instars, in the presence of ultra-low quantities of nanoformulated botanicals, which boost their predation rates.},

Here, we show that there is a strong correlation between the incidence of Zika in Colombian departments and the force of infection (but not the crude incidence) of dengue, a virus transmitted by the same mosquito species, Aedes aegypti (R2 = 0.41, p{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, we show that there is also a strong correlation between the incidence of microcephaly in Brazilian states and the force of infection of dengue (R2 = 0.36, p{\textless}0.001). Because dengue, Zika and Chikungunya are transmitted by the same vector, these associations provide further support to the supposition that Zika virus infection during pregnancy causes microcephaly. In addition, they provide an opportunity to project the expected incidence of microcephaly in multiple dengue endemic locations across Colombia and the American continent. Detailed knowledge of dengue transmission should be use to target efforts against Zika and other flaviviruses.},

	abstract = {The current outbreak of Zika virus poses a threat of unknown magnitude to human health. While the range of the virus has been cataloged growing slowly over the last 50 years, the recent explosive expansion in the Americas indicates that the full potential distribution of Zika remains uncertain. Moreover, most current epidemiology relies on its similarities to dengue fever, a phylogenetically closely related disease of unknown similarity in spatial range or ecological niche. Here we compile the first spatially explicit global occurrence dataset from Zika viral surveillance and serological surveys, and construct ecological niche models to test basic hypotheses about its spread and potential establishment. The hypothesis that the outbreak of cases in Mexico and North America are anomalous and outside the ecological niche of the disease, and may be linked to El Nino or similar climatic events, remains plausible at this time. Comparison of the Zika niche against the known distribution of dengue fever suggests that Zika is more constrained by the seasonality of precipitation and diurnal temperature fluctuations, likely confining the disease to the tropics outside of pandemic scenarios. Projecting the range of the diseases in conjunction with vector species (Aedes africanus, Ae. aegypti, and Ae. albopictus) that transmit the pathogens, under climate change, suggests that Zika has potential for northward expansion; but, based on current knowledge, Zika is unlikely to fill the full range its vectors occupy. With recent sexual transmission of the virus known to have occurred in the United States, we caution that our results only apply to the vector-borne aspect of the disease, and while the threat of a mosquito-carried Zika pandemic may be overstated in the media, other transmission modes of the virus may emerge and facilitate naturalization worldwide.},

Although there is an intuitive link between life history and fitness, there are in fact several measures of the 'black box' concept of fitness. There has been a debate in the bio-mathematical literature on the predictive difference between the two most commonly used measures; intrinsic rate of increase, and net reproductive ratio R-0. Although both measures aim to describe fitness, models using one of the measures may predict the opposite of similar models using the other measure, which is clearly undesirable. Here, I review the evolution of these fitness measures over the last four decades, the predictive differences between these measures and the resulting shift of the fitness concept. I focus in particular on some recent developments, which have solved the dilemma of predictive differences between these fitness measures by explicitly acknowledging the game-theoretical nature of life-history evolution.},

In variable environments, there may be extrinsic differences between breeding periods within an organism's life, affecting both offspring and parent and giving rise to intergenerational trade-offs. Such trade-offs are often discussed in terms of reproductive value for parent and offspring. Here, we consider parental life-history optimization in response to varying offspring values of a population regulated by territoriality, where the quality of the environment varies periodically. Periods are interpreted as either within-year (seasonality) or between-years variation (cyclicity). The evolutionarily stable strategy in a general model with two-phased periodicity in the environment ran generate either higher or lower effort in the more favorable of the two phases; hence knowing survival prospects of offspring does not suffice for predicting reproductive effort-the future of all descendants and the parent must be tracked. We also apply our method to data on the Ural owl Strix uralensis, a species preying on cyclically fluctuating voles. The observed dynamics are best predicted by assuming delayed reproductive costs and Type II functional response. Accounting for varying offspring values can lead to cases where both reproductive effort and recruitment of offspring are higher in the phase when voles are not maximally abundant, a pattern supported by our data.},

Using such an invasion criterion to characterize fitness implicitly presupposes a scenario in which, during periods of clear evolutionary change, the rate of evolution is set primarily by the random occurrence (and initial establishment) of favourable mutations.

	abstract = {I consider a population structured by age, size, condition, or any other relevant state variable. The environment fluctuates from year to year. Each year population members must make a reproductive decision before the environmental conditions of that year are known. I follow the standard approach in which one considers a subpopulation composed of individuals of the same genotype in an asexual species (or of individuals sharing the same allele for controlling behaviour in a sexual species). The fitness of the genotype is then defined as an appropriate growth rate for this subpopulation. The structure vector for the subpopulation describes the distribution of individual states of subpopulation members. Here the collective action of subpopulation members is viewed as giving an immediate reward to the genotype (or allele) and influencing the distribution of the structure vector next year. Fitness is characterised as the long-term average reward so obtained. Reproductive value is defined on structure vectors, that is, on distributions of states, not on individual states. An optimal strategy maximises the sum of the current reward and the expected reproductive value of the structure vector in one year's time. In this definition of optimality, individuals are allowed to base their actions on the current structure vector and hence on the current states of kin. When individuals are only allowed to base their actions on their own state, an optimal strategy maximises an appropriate average of current reward plus expected future reproductive value. The optimality criteria described lead to natural methods by which optimal strategies can be calculated.},

The epidemic of congenital rubella that followed, with 25 serologically confirmed cases (24.6 per 100 000 live births), was probably the largest such epidemic in Greece after 1950, Conclusions With low vaccination coverage, the immunisation of boys and girls aged 1 year against rubella carries the theoretical risk of increasing the occurrence of congenital rubella. This phenomenon, which has not been previously reported, occurred in Greece.},

A cohort study was done to identify exposures associated with cases that likely were the result of cross-transmission (i. e., occurring in clusters and with indistinguishable MRSA macrorestriction profiles). Fitting a simple stochastic model to the ascertained data allowed prediction of the effectiveness of infection control measures. Exposure to relative staff deficit (adjusted rate ratio, 1.05 independent; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 Â­ 1.09) was the only factor significantly associated with potential transmission ( P = .001). It was predicted that a 12\% improvement in adherence to hand-hygiene policies might have compensated for staff shortage and prevented transmission during periods of overcrowding, shared care, and high workload but that this would be hard to achieve.},

Although the symptoms of ZIKV are mild, recent evidence suggests a relationship between prenatal exposure to ZIKV and microcephaly. This has led to widespread panic, including travel alerts and warnings to avoid pregnancy. Because ZIKV is an emerging disease, response efforts are complicated by limited understanding of disease dynamics. To this end, we develop a novel state- and class-structured compartment model for ZIKV. Our model shows that the risk of prenatal ZIKV exposure should decrease dramatically following the initial wave of disease, reaching almost undetectable levels in endemic systems. Our model also suggests that efforts to reduce ZIKV prenatal exposures through mosquito management and avoidance may have minimal benefit, and may even result in increased risk of microcephaly in later years of an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Recent pandemic planning has highlighted the importance of understanding the effect that widespread antiviral use will have on the emergence and spread of resistance. A number of recent studies have determined that if resistance to antiviral medication can evolve, then deploying treatment at a less than maximum rate often minimizes the outbreak size. This finding, however, involves the assumption that treatment levels remain constant during the entire outbreak. Using optimal control theory, we address the question of optimal antiviral use by considering a large class of time-varying treatment strategies. We prove that, contrary to previous results, it is always optimal to treat at the maximum rate provided that this treatment occurs at the right time. In general the optimal strategy is to wait some fixed amount of time and then to deploy treatment at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. We derive analytical conditions that characterize this optimal amount of delay. Our results show that it is optimal to start treatment immediately when one of the following conditions holds: (i) immediate treatment can prevent an outbreak, (ii) the initial pool of susceptibles is small, or (iii) when the maximum possible rate of treatment is low, such that there is little de novo emergence of resistant strains. Finally, we use numerical simulations to verify that the results also hold under more general conditions.},

We instead, provide analytic solutions for the control that minimizes the outbreak size (or infectious burden) under the assumption that there are limited control resources. We provide optimal control policies for an isolation only model, a vaccination only model and a combined isolationâ€“vaccination model (or mixed model). The optimal policies described here contain many interesting features especially when compared to previous analyses. For example, under certain circumstances the optimal isolation only policy is not unique. Furthermore the optimal mixed policy is not simply a combination of the optimal isolation only policy and the optimal vaccination only policy. The results presented here also highlight a number of areas that warrant further study and emphasize that time-optimal control of the basic SIR model is still not fully understood.},

New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission. Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R 0, should exceed one, where R 0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population. However, an increase in R 0, even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R 0 {\textgreater} 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.},

We demonstrate that susceptible data reconstructed by our method improve the performance of forecasting models. Our estimate of susceptible class dynamics also can be used to estimate the age distribution of recruitment into the susceptible class, if the birth rate is known from independent data. Simulation experiments show that the reconstruction is robust to errors in the reporting scheme.

Despite the important understanding afforded by the probability and simulation paradigm, this approach does not directly address important questions about the structure of contact networks such as what is the best network model for a particular mode of disease transmission, how parameter values of a given model should be estimated, or how precisely the data allow us to estimate these parameter values.

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes morbidity and mortality in a range of animals and threatens local economies by acting as a barrier to international trade. The outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001 that cost billions to control highlighted the risk that the pathogen poses to agriculture. In response, several mathematical models have been developed to parameterize and predict both transmission dynamics and optimal disease control. However, a lack of understanding of the multi-strain etiology prevents characterization of multi-strain dynamics. Here, we use data from FMDV serology in an endemic setting to probe strain-specific transmission and immunodynamics. Five serotypes of FMDV affect cattle in the Far North Region of Cameroon. We fit both catalytic and reverse catalytic models to serological data to estimate the force of infection and the rate of waning immunity, and to detect periods of sustained transmission. For serotypes SAT2, SAT3, and type A, a model assuming life-long immunity fit better. For serotypes SAT1 and type O, the better-fit model suggests that immunity may wane over time. Our analysis further indicates that type O has the greatest force of infection and the longest duration of immunity. Estimates for the force of infection were time-varying and indicated that serotypes SAT1 and O displayed endemic dynamics, serotype A displayed epidemic dynamics, and SAT2 and SAT3 did not sustain local chains of transmission. Since these results were obtained from the same population at the same time, they highlight important differences in transmission specific to each serotype. They also show that immunity wanes at rates specific to each serotype, which influences patterns of local persistence. Overall, this work shows that viral serotypes can differ significantly in their epidemiological and immunological characteristics. Patterns and processes that drive transmission in endemic settings must consider complex viral dynamics for accurate representation and interpretation.},

In this paper, we focus on the movements of pastoralists in the Far North Region of Cameroon, who follow an annual transhumance by moving between rainy and dry season pastures. Describing, summarizing, and modeling the transhumance movements in the region are important steps for understanding the role these movements may play in the transmission of infectious diseases affecting humans and animals. We collected data on this transhumance system for four years using a combination of surveys and GPS mapping. An analysis on the spatial and temporal characteristics of pastoral mobility suggests four transhumance modes, each with its own properties. Modes M1 and M2 represent the type of transhumance movements where pastoralists settle in a campsite for a relatively long period of time (â‰¥20 days) and then move around the area without specific directions within a seasonal grazing area. Modes M3 and M4 on the other hand are the situations when pastoralists stay in a campsite for a relatively short period of time ({\textless}20 days) when moving between seasonal grazing areas. These four modes are used to develop a spatial-temporal mobility (STM) model that can be used to estimate the probability of a mobile pastoralist residing at a location at any time. We compare the STM model with two reference models and the experiments suggest that the STM model can effectively capture and predict the space-time dynamics of pastoral mobility in our study area.},

Consistent with previous suggestions,, our results show that weak to intermediate strength links are important in promoting community persistence and stability. Weak links act to dampen oscillations between consumers and resources. This tends to maintain population densities further away from zero, decreasing the statistical chance that a population will become extinct (lower population densities are more prone to such chances). Data on interaction strengths in natural food webs indicate that food-web interaction strengths are indeed characterized by many weak interactions and a few strong interactions.},

We define a measure of assortative mixing for networks and use it to show that social networks are often assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. We propose a model of an assortative network, which we study both analytically and numerically. Within the framework of this model we find that assortative networks tend to percolate more easily than their disassortative counterparts and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.},

High quality observational data on contact patterns, usually presented in the form of age-specific contact matrices, are difficult to gather and are currently available only for few countries worldwide. Here we propose a computational approach, based on the simulation of a virtual society of agents, allowing the estimation of contact patterns by age for 26 European countries. We validate the estimated contact matrices against those obtained by the most extensive field study on contact patterns, with data collected in eight European countries. We show that our contact matrices share some common features, e.g. individuals tend to mix preferentially with individuals their own age, and country-specific differences, which can be partly explained by differences in population structures due to different demographic trajectories followed after WWII. Our analysis highlights well defined correlations between epidemiological parameters and socio-demographic features of the populations. This study provides the first estimates of contact matrices for many European countries where specific experimental data are still not available.},

Recently, new methods for estimating R0 using social contact data and serological survey data have been proposed. These methods, like most of their predecessors, ignore individual heterogeneity, and are sensitive to perturbation of the contact function. Using a frailty framework, we derive expressions for R0 in the presence of age-varying heterogeneity. In this case, R0 is the spectral radius of a population version of the next generation operator, which involves the variance function of the age-dependent frailty. This variance can be estimated within a shared frailty framework from paired data on two infections transmitted by the same route. We propose two estimators of R0 for infections in endemic equilibrium. We investigate their performance by simulation, and find that one is generally less efficient but more robust than the other to perturbation of the effective contact function. These methods are applied to data on varicella zoster virus infection from two European countries.},

These methods exploit the correlations between ages at infection for different infections within individuals. The methods are developed for serological surveys, which provide accessible individual data on several infections, and are applied to a wide range of infections. We find that childhood infections are often highly correlated within individuals in early childhood, with the correlations persisting into adulthood only for infections sharing a transmission route. We discuss 2 applications of the methods: 1) to making inferences about routes of transmission when these are unknown or uncertain and 2) to estimating epidemiologic parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the critical immunization threshold. Two examples of such applications are presented: elucidating the transmission route of polyomaviruses BK and JC and estimating the basic reproduction number and critical immunization coverage of varicella-zoster infection in Belgium, Italy, Poland, and England and Wales. We speculate that childhood correlations stem from confounding of different transmission routes and represent heterogeneity in childhood circumstances, notably nursery-school attendance. In contrast, it is suggested that correlations in adulthood are route-specific.},

	abstract = {Models of infectious disease spread that incorporate contact heterogeneity through contact networks are an important tool for epidemiologists studying disease dynamics and assessing intervention strategies. One of the challenges of contact network epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population's contact structure. In this study, we evaluate the utility of common epidemiological measures (R0, epidemic peak size, duration and final size) for inferring the degree of heterogeneity in a population's unobserved contact structure through a Bayesian approach. We test the method using ground truth data and find that some of these epidemiological metrics are effective at classifying contact heterogeneity. The classification is also consistent across pathogen transmission probabilities, and so can be applied even when this characteristic is unknown. In particular, the reproductive number, R0, turns out to be a poor classifier of the degree heterogeneity, while, unexpectedly, final epidemic size is a powerful predictor of network structure across the range of heterogeneity. We also evaluate our framework on empirical epidemiological data from past and recent outbreaks to demonstrate its application in practice and to gather insights about the relevance of particular contact structures for both specific systems and general classes of infectious disease. We thus introduce a simple approach that can shed light on the unobserved connectivity of a host population given epidemic data. Our study has the potential to inform future data-collection efforts and study design by driving our understanding of germane epidemic measures, and highlights a general inferential approach to learning about host contact structure in contemporary or historic populations of humans and animals.},

In the case of perfectly immunizing infections, observations of strong sensitivity to demographic variation have been mechanistically explained through analysis of the susceptibleâ€“infectedâ€“recovered (SIR) model that assumes lifelong immunity following recovery from infection. When imperfect immunity is incorporated into this framework via the susceptibleâ€“infectedâ€“recoveredâ€“susceptible (SIRS) model, with individuals regaining full susceptibility following recovery, we show that rapid loss of immunity is predicted to buffer populations against the effects of demographic change. However, this buffering is contrary to the dependence on demography recently observed for partially immunizing infections such as rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. We show that this discrepancy arises from a key simplification embedded in the SIR(S) framework, namely that the potential for differential immune responses to repeat exposures is ignored. We explore the minimum additional immunological information that must be included to reflect the range of observed dependencies on demography. We show that including partial protection and lower transmission following primary infection is sufficient to capture more realistic reduced levels of buffering, in addition to changes in epidemic timing, across a range of partially and fully immunizing infections. Furthermore, our results identify key variables in this relationship, including R0.},

Vaccination against measles has many benefits, not only lifelong protection against this potentially serious virus. Mina et al. analyzed data collected since mass vaccination began in high-income countries when measles was common. Measles vaccination is associated with less mortality from other childhood infections. Measles is known to cause transient immunosuppression, but close inspection of the mortality data suggests that it disables immune memory for 2 to 3 years. Vaccination thus does more than safeguard children against measles; it also stops other infections taking advantage of measles-induced immune damage.
Science, this issue p. 694
Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of vaccinating males against the human papillomavirus (HPV) remains a controversial subject. Many existing studies conclude that increasing female coverage is more effective than diverting resources into male vaccination. Recently, several empirical studies on HPV immunization have been published, providing evidence of the fact that marginal vaccination costs increase with coverage. In this study, we use a stochastic agent-based modeling framework to revisit the male vaccination debate in light of these new findings. Within this framework, we assess the impact of coverage-dependent marginal costs of vaccine distribution on optimal immunization strategies against HPV. Focusing on the two scenarios of ongoing and new vaccination programs, we analyze different resource allocation policies and their effects on overall disease burden. Our results suggest that if the costs associated with vaccinating males are relatively close to those associated with vaccinating females, then coverage-dependent, increasing marginal costs may favor vaccination strategies that entail immunization of both genders. In particular, this study emphasizes the necessity for further empirical research on the nature of coverage-dependent vaccination costs.},
