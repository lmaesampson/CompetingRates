# CompetingRates
A competing rates model for seroprevalence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Jupyter notebook included (Stable_DRC.ipynb) that generates MCMC samples used in paper. DRC data is not public, so unfortunately cannot be included, but simulated dataset (Data/FakeData50_veff1.0.csv for sim. processed to DRC-like data, contents of Simulation/ for raw data) is here, along with code for taking raw simulation output and generating DRC-like data (FakeData.ipynb).
