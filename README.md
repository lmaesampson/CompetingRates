# CompetingRates
A competing rates model for seroprevalence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Jupyter notebook included (Stable_DRC.ipynb) that generates MCMC samples used in paper. DRC data is not public, so unfortunately cannot be included, but simulated dataset (FakeData_veff1.0.csv, contents of Simulation/) is here, along with code for taking raw simulation output and generating DRC-like data (FakeData.ipynb).
